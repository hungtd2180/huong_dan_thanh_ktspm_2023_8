1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,400
A lot of architects believe their job is done once the document is delivered.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,020
This is a big mistake.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,690
Huge software architecture is a living, breathing creature and it changes all the time.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,830
You have to be there for the developers to help them to make sure they are developing according to the

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,900
architecture and to be part of the dilemmas that are going to be raised and are going to be a lot of

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,000
dilemmas, arguments and talks, and the architecture will be changed and not only once.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,530
So you have to support the team.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,390
If you don't want the documents to become a glorified paperweight and remember, you are not done until

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,770
the system is in production and even then you probably will have a lot to do.
