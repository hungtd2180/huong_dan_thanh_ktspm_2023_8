1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,520
The first thing on architecture should do when beginning a work on a new system is to understand the

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,870
system's requirements.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,860
Okay.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,450
Well, actually, the first thing is to understand the system's goals, as we discussed earlier in this

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,020
course.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,650
But an actual architectural process begins with the requirements.

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,610
Remember, the requirements describe what the system should do.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,970
They usually begin with high level tasks such as allow end users to view telemetry data and often describe

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,110
also workflows, logical services and user interface elements.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,400
Those requirements are usually defined by the system analyst who works directly with the client.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,000
So in most cases, your first work meeting after the obligatory introductory meeting will be with the

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,080
system analyst.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,000
In this meeting you will discuss the requirements of the new system and probably set dates for future

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,680
meetings on the same subject.
