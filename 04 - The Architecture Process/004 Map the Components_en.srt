00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,120
The next phase of the architecture process is mapping the various components of the system.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,000
The components are the moving parts of the system.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,100
They represent the various tasks of the system functional as well as non-functional.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,280
The component map serves two goals.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,590
It helps you understand the system and its various parts.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,190
It's a great way to communicate to the client your understanding of the system, thus making sure you

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,570
are not missing anything.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,610
Note that the component map is completely non-technical.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,690
You are yet to decide on the platform, the development tool, the database type.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,570
This is just a map that displays the various capabilities of the system.
