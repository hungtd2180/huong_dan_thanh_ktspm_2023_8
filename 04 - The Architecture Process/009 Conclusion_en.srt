1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,380
So this is the architectural process I use with almost all of my clients and I recommend you to do the

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:05,950
same.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,080
Be aware that there almost always be some variations on the process.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:16,300
For example, one subject you should be aware of is who else participates in every step of the process.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,900
Let's look at the non-functional requirements step.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,120
Obviously you, the architect, cannot decide what are the non-functional requirements without talking

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,530
to the client and the system analyst and the architectural design phase.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,850
Are you supposed to do it all by yourself or should you involve the developers?

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,730
The answer is, as always, it depends.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,390
If the developers are available for taking part in the architecture, then by all means work with them.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,170
It's extremely important to let them be part of the process because you will earn two benefits.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,630
First, if there are some scenarios you are not aware of but the developers know about, it will be

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,070
better to talk about them as early as possible and not when the architecture is done.

14
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,110
Second, since the architecture was built together with the development team, you neutralize any future

15
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,950
disagreement.

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,530
Moreover, this way the developers become ambassadors of you and the architecture, and they will convince

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,360
the other project members that the architecture is a good one and should be used.

18
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,180
This will make your job much easier and will free your time to work on the really important things instead

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,800
of organizational politics.

20
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,080
In the next sections, we will deep dive into each of the steps we have talked about and we'll understand

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,960
the ins and outs of the tasks you, the architect, has to execute in order to design a good and practical

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,770
architecture.

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,760
Let's go.
