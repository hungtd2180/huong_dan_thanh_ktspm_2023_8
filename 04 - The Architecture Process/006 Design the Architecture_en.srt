1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,450
This is the heart of your work.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,040
You already have the requirements, the non-functional requirements, the components and the technology

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,590
stack.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:13,010
All that's left is to design the architecture that will glue all those together and will result in a

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,090
system that is fast, secure, reliable and easy to maintain.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,700
We will learn about the qualities of a well-designed system such as loose coupling, stateless scaling,

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,460
caching, messaging and lots more and see how those qualities are used as the building blocks of the

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,360
architecture.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,450
When you are done, you will have a complete architecture in place, but it won't be formalized yet.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,890
Which brings us to the next step.
