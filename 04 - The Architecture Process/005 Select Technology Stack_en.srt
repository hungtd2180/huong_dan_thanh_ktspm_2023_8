1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,120
This is one of the most important steps in this process.

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,920
In this step, you are going to decide together with the development team, what will be the platform

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,930
on which the system will be based.

4
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,440
Usually there will be more than one technology to be used in most systems.

5
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,140
You will have to select the back end platform, the front end platform and the data store platform.

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,020
In addition, in some systems such as ones that are based on microservices architecture, you will often

7
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,370
select multiple back end platforms and perhaps also multiple data stores.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,410
As we will see in the relevant section.

9
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,480
There are a lot of factors you have to consider when selecting the technology stack, and the selection

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,010
must be very rational.

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,370
A wrong technology stack can lead to failure of the whole system.
