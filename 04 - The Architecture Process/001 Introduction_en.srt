00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,610
Welcome to the Architectural Process section.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,490
In this section, we will discuss the process of the architect's work in order to make the architecture

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,240
as useful as possible and to provide the maximum value to the client.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,100
The architect should follow a well defined roadmap that at the end will lead to a practical and well

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,860
thought of architecture which will ensure the system is fast, secure, reliable and easy to maintain.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,640
In this section we will talk about this process.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,940
I will give a brief overview of each step in the process and describe its importance.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,050
In later sections.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,830
We will deep dive into each step and talk about what exactly should be done.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,920
So here are the steps in the architectural process.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,660
Understand the system's requirements.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,600
Understand the non-functional requirements.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,460
Map the components.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,620
Select the technology stack.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,630
Design the architecture.

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,890
Write the architecture document.

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,950
Support the development team.

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,170
Let's talk about these steps.
