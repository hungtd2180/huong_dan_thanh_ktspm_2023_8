1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,790
This is what you were waiting for.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:05,060
This is a culmination of all the efforts you've put into the system.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,220
And this is your greatest creation.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,350
The architecture document describes the whole process you have been through and gives the developers

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,740
and management a full picture of the system that is going to be built.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,350
A good architecture document is relevant for all the levels in the organization the CEO, the CIO,

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,930
the project manager, and of course, the developers.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,300
They will all find great value in it.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,520
We will talk a lot about the structure and the content of the document in the relevant section and explain

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,290
how to maximize its value.
