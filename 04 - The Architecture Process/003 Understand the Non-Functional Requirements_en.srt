00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,780
The next step in the architectural process is to understand the non-functional requirements of the system.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,210
Non-functional requirements are a special kind of requirements that define some technical and service

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,040
level attributes of the system.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,160
For example, the most common non-functional requirements are about concurrent number of users, heavy

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,490
loads, volumes of data and performance.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,790
As we will see in a later section, the client and the system analyst are usually not aware of the non-functional

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,650
requirements and it's the architect's job to help them formulate those requirements.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,370
For us, the architects, the non-functional requirements are much more important than the regular requirements.

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,760
I never begin to work on a system before knowing exactly what its non-functional requirements are because

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,870
so many architectural elements can be affected by those requirements.
