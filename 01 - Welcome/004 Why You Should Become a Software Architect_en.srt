1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,120
Before discussing the how.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,500
Let's talk about the why.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,930
Why is it a good idea to be a software architect?

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,640
What's so attractive about it?

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,930
Good question.

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,650
There are three very good reasons to be a software architect.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,000
One, this is a really, really, very interesting job.

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:24,320
As a software architect, your daily routine may include talking to CXO that CEOs, CFOs, CIOs and

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,840
more discussing technology with development manager and conducting some research about new patterns

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,890
and platforms.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:37,070
There truly is no other role in the software industry, which is as diverse, broad and spread across

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,160
the whole organization as the role of the architect.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,520
As we will see later in this course, a good architects work involves business, technology, methodology,

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,080
soft skills and more.

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,910
I can promise you this as an architect, you are not going to get bored ever.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,000
Reason number two Career path and visibility.

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,530
Being an architect, you communicate with all levels of the organization that will make you quite visible

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,560
to management and will pave the way to future promotions.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,380
One of my friends was a developer for five years and felt it's time to move on.

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,690
He wasn't sure what kind of job to look for and knowing him and his abilities, I recommended him to

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,820
look for a junior architect position.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,030
After a couple of weeks, he landed a job and was amazed by the amount of communication he had with

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,310
the CEO and CIO of the company.

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,780
Today he is a senior architect in one of the largest companies on the planet.

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,310
So yes, being a software architect can definitely push your career forward.

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,760
Reason number three, money.

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,570
Everyone wants it, but few are ready to talk about it.

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,360
But take a look at these numbers.

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,430
As you can see, the average salary of an architect is almost double the salary of a developer.

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,840
Here, I'll just be quiet for a few seconds while you are crunching the numbers.

31
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,050
But honestly, you should not go for the money.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,840
A good architect is someone who loves what she does.

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,150
You should love the challenge and enjoy the discussions, embrace the research, and only then think

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,080
about the money.

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,070
So to recap, here are the three reasons to be an architect.

36
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,880
And believe me, these reasons are real.

37
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,230
If you are looking for an interesting, promising and rewarding role, go be a software architect.
