Hello and welcome to the Complete Guide to Becoming a software Architect Course.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,920
A few years ago, I had a meeting with a potential client.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:15,250
The meeting took place in his office at the 34th floor in one of the skyscrapers in the city.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,230
He began the meeting by asking me.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,470
Tell me, Mami, why do I need a software architect?

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,340
I have a talented group of developers and a great IT department.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,280
Isn't that enough for building great software?

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,160
I thought for a second and then told him.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,980
What would you do if I told you this building we are sitting in had no architect involved in its design

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,360
and construction process.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,850
The workers came in every morning, put the cement tucked in the steel beams and went home.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:49,000
He looked at me for a few seconds, then jumped from his chair, got in the nearest elevator and ran

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,960
for his life.

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,040
Well, okay.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,350
He didn't really do that, but he did tell me.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,510
Okay, mami, now I get it.

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,740
And what about you?

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,690
Do you want to be a software architect?

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,210
Do you want to know what it means to be a software architect?

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,730
Do you have no idea about software architecture whatsoever?

21
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,000
Or maybe you just want to be a much better developer.

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,970
You have come to the right place.

23
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,450
Software architect is one of the most interesting, rewarding and challenging jobs in the software industry.

24
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,180
And in this course, I will teach you everything you need to know in order to become one a great one.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,970
This is a practical, experience based, comprehensive course that will guide you step by step towards

26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,370
becoming an exceptional software architect.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,910
Throughout this course, we will discuss not only high level principles, but also real world examples,

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,720
down to earth techniques, and the soft skills required for this job.

29
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,990
This is a really packed course.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,070
It contains a lot of materials.

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,180
All stemmed from my experience of 15 years as an architect.

32
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,120
If you feel a specific lecture is not clear enough, do not hesitate to contact me via the Q&A button.

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,290
I promise to answer any question, but that's not all.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,390
Towards the end of this course, you will be able to download a real practical software architectural

35
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,990
document, which is the heart of every software architect's work.

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,130
You are more than invited to read it, learn from it, and even use it in your own projects.

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,790
Just fill in the blanks and you are good to go.

38
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,430
Now, for those of you who don't know me.

39
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,480
Nice to meet you.

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,940
My name is Mami Lavie and I'm a software architect with 15 years of experience.

41
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,700
I've worked with large enterprises, big multinational companies, start ups, and lots more.

42
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,240
My technology stack is quite diverse and includes, among others, Dotnet, Java, Python, SQL Server,

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,270
Oracle, MongoDB, React, Angular, Azure, a little bit of AWS and lots more.

44
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,660
I've had my fair share of successes as well as some painful failures.

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,590
I always strive to learn from my and others experience and during the years I've developed a simple

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,660
and practical architecture process which I've been using in a lot of projects.

47
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,870
But enough about me.

48
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,280
Let's talk about you.
