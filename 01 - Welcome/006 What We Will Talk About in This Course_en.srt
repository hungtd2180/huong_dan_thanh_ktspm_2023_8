1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,080
So what are we going to talk about in this course?

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,540
Well, we are going to cover a lot of materials.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,250
First is the welcome section, which we are in right now.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,910
Then we'll talk about the definition of a software architect.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,880
As you will see, there are several types of architect.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:23,030
We will describe some of them and then focus on the types that really interest us, the software architect.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,360
Then we will discuss what is perhaps the biggest change a software architect should do in order to bring

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,400
the maximum benefit to their organization.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,940
Adopt a business mindset instead of a technological one.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,770
We will talk about the meaning of this mindset and why it's so important for the architect.

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,140
The fourth section in this course outlines the architectural process.

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,910
What are the actual steps the architect should take in order to build a robust yet practical architecture

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,010
for the system she is working on?

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,430
The next sections deep dive into this process and detail the specifics of each step.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,620
The working with System Requirements section talks about the importance of fully understanding the system

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,270
requirements and introduces us to the concept of non-functional requirements.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,430
After we have discussed the requirements, we will turn our attention to the application itself.

18
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,080
The first thing an architect should do is define the type of the application.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,240
And in this section we will explore the various types of mainstream application types and what are the

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,160
main attributes of each type.

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,320
After we have decided on the application type, it's time to select the technology stack.

22
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,720
In this section, we will discuss the various considerations for selecting technology stack and explore

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,220
various implementation options for front end, Back end and data store.

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,110
Having selected the technology stack, it's time to start talking about the architecture.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,280
But wait.

26
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,890
Before discussing architecture, we need to meet a set of capabilities that will help us design an architecture

27
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,740
that fulfills the non-functional requirements.

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,650
And in order to fully understand the non-functional requirements, we will meet the style highlights.

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,050
No, they are not a family of weirdos, but a set of non-functional requirements every architect should

30
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,520
know about and make sure her architecture is well suited for them.

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,590
And now it's time to start looking at the components of the applications.

32
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,780
Components are the building blocks of almost every application, and they must be designed correctly

33
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,890
in order to ensure the application is fast, efficient and easy to maintain.

34
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,240
In this section, we will deep dive into the attributes of a well-designed component.

35
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:37,120
Note This is going to be a little bit low level, but it's a must for every architect to be able to

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,310
look at the code without fainting.

37
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,560
The next section is an introduction to design patterns.

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,450
You probably heard of design patterns already, but even if not, don't worry, we will discuss the

39
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,540
idea behind the design patterns and delve into some of them.

40
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,420
Having talked about the micro level of the system, it's time to take a step back and look at the macro

41
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,700
level as the system as a whole.

42
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,340
In order for a system to be reliable, fast, secure and easy to maintain, it's important to take into

43
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,490
consideration the various attributes of a well-designed system.

44
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,050
We will discuss those attributes and understand how they affect the architecture.

45
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,410
Every seasoned architect knows that architectural decisions are rarely made on a pure technical basis.

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,820
There are always other considerations and constraints that must be taken into account.

47
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,980
In the next section, we will explore the most common constraints and see how they might affect the

48
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,910
architecture.

49
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,340
And then drum, please.

50
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,860
We arrive to what is perhaps the most important section in this course, the architecture document.

51
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,610
This document is a culmination of the architectural process.

52
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,890
It is the product of the requirements technology, stack components, architecture systems, architecture,

53
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,150
external considerations, coffee saturated meetings and long silent writing sessions.

54
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,880
The document describes the architecture designed for the system and contains everything the developers

55
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,570
and team leaders need to know in order to start developing the system.

56
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,240
In this section, we will go through the documents, goal, audience and structure and discuss the content

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,950
of each section in the document.

58
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,570
After we have talked about the document, it's time to put everything we talked about to test.

59
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,690
In the case study section, we will discuss a system we need to design for a fictional Iot company.

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,310
We will go together through all the steps we talked about, understand the requirements, decide on

61
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,770
the technology stack map and design the various components, and talk about the architecture document

62
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,640
structure.

63
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,070
At the end of this section, you will find a very special bonus, an architecture document complete

64
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,450
with all the sections discussed in this course ready for you to download and use.

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,460
You can use it as a template for your future documents or as a reference for your own document.

66
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,500
But anyway, it's yours to use.

67
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,490
Enjoy it.

68
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,740
The software architecture is a moving, vibrant world, and there are always new trends and advances.

69
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:04,000
The next section explores some advanced architectural concepts, such as microservices and event sourcing.

70
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,400
Don't worry if you don't know what these mean.

71
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,480
I'll explain it all.

72
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,570
And the last, but not the least of this course section deals with soft skills.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,360
A good architect must practice her soft skills.

74
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,230
You need to know how to speak to people, how to listen, what to do with criticism.

75
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,910
And you will get a lot of this.

76
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,760
How to deal with organizational politics and more.

77
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,370
The Soft Skills section deals with those topics, and I encourage you to pay close attention to it.

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,850
This might be exactly what will make you a great architect.

79
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,790
And after all this, we will conclude and reflect on what we have learned together.

80
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,630
So brace yourself for the fascinating world of software architecture, and let's go.
