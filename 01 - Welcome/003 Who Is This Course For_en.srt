1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,930
So who is the perfect audience for this course?

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,520
In order to benefit the most from this course, you must have some background in programming.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,940
It doesn't really matter which platform you are currently programming with.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,450
It could be Java Dotnet, PHP or anything else.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,550
There won't be coding in this course.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,310
However, this course might not be a good fit for general developers who take their first steps in the

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,480
programming world.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,750
We will be discussing some advanced software principles which junior developers might not be aware of,

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,390
and this might make it more difficult for them to grasp the concepts described in this course.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,720
In addition, it would be better to have some backend experience.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,630
Most architectural dilemmas present themselves in the back end where performance security, caching

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,570
and other considerations are extremely important.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,780
So to sum it up, the perfect audience for this course is someone with three years of experience as

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,770
a developer with backend development experience.

15
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,880
However, anyone with some development experience will benefit from this course and you are more than

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,350
invited to contact me regarding any question you have about this course material.
