Welcome to the Advanced Architecture Patterns section.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,530
By now, we have learned about the most common architectural patterns such as stateless scaling, loose

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,540
coupling and layered architecture.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,880
You will probably use these patterns in almost every system you will design, and I'm sure they will

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,690
serve you well.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,760
However, these are not the only patterns exist.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,090
The software architecture world is an ever changing and evolving world, and new patterns frequently

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,660
emerge.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,280
In this section, I would like to give you a taste of some of the more advanced architectural patterns

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,180
exist today.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,310
You will probably not use them in every system, but it's always a good idea to keep them in mind.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,460
And when an opportunity presents itself, use them.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,590
We are not going to deep dive into these patterns.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,610
This will require a course of itself, but we will get the gist of these patterns so you will know they

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,020
exist when relevant.

16
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,990
So these are the patterns we will discuss.

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,180
Microservices event sourcing and seekers.

18
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,900
Don't worry if you are not familiar with these patterns.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
That's why I'm here for.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,099
So let's go.
