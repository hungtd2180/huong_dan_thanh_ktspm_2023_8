00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,530
We have reached the end of this section.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,390
In this section, we discussed some advanced architectural patterns, namely microservices event sourcing

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,810
and.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,630
I hope you liked these patterns and understood what their goals are and when to use them.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,780
Remember, only use these patterns when relevant.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,090
These patterns add complexity to the architecture, and this is a trade off that is not always justified.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,100
Remember to take a look at the resources of the lectures in this section where you can find references

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,610
for more reading materials about these patterns.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,560
And now let's move on to the next section.
