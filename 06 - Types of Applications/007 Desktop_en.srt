00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,190
Desktop applications are the poor boys of the app world.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,360
In a world where web APIs and clouds are all the rage.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,010
Almost nobody talks about desktop apps and for good reason.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,580
Desktop apps are applications that run mainly on the PC.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,610
It's important to differentiate it from rich client apps that access Web API and are only a thin visual

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,080
layer above the data.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,330
I'm talking here about an application that has all its resources, including logic and data on the local

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:26,660
PC.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,110
This application might be using the internet for some arbitrary tasks, such as validating license or

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,430
sending activity logs, but it will still be fully functional when offline.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,200
Another aspect of desktop application is its UI or user interface.

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,240
Desktop apps are targeted for end users and they will usually have a great user interface.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,980
One good example of such an application is Microsoft Word, which works with or without an active Internet

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,440
connection.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,070
Of course, you will lose some capabilities when offline, such as cloud connectivity, but it is still

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,370
fully functional this way due to massive use of cloud computing and the ubiquity of internet connectivity.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,830
Desktop apps popularity is dwindling.

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:15,930
You will use desktop apps mainly for user centric actions such as word processing or calculations and

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,090
heavy gaming.

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,500
But again, you can spend a lifetime as an architect without designing desktop apps even once.
