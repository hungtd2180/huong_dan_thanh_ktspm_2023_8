Welcome to the Application Types section.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,420
In this section we will discuss the various application types and architect will work with one of the

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,340
first things an architect should do when working on a system is to determine what kind of applications

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,660
the system is going to be.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,120
This decision is usually made after working on the requirements, either functional or non-functional.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,950
In this phase, you have already learned what can be learned about the functionality of the system and

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,990
the environment it will be operating in.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,509
And you can make an educational decision about the type of applications that best fits these requirements.

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,010
This is an important decision since each type has its own pros and cons.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,990
Moreover, once the decision is made, it's usually not easy to switch to other types.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:51,680
The most common application types are web apps, web API, mobile console service and desktop.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,900
Let's go and discuss each one of them.
