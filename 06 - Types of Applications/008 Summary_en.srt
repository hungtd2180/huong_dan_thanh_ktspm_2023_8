00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,910
We've gone through the most common application types you will encounter as an architect.

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,200
However, today in the cloud era, there are many more types of applications.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,320
For example, one of the hottest trend today is function as a service implemented by the likes of AWS,

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,230
Lambda or Azure Functions, which allows the developer to write a short focused code segments and not

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,840
worry about servers, scale or SLA.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,260
Applications built on these functions are not web apps or web API and represent a new type of applications.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,070
But still most apps today fall into the categories we discussed.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,410
One of the first tasks you will have when beginning work on a system is to determine which application

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,180
type is best suited for it.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,760
Often a system will comprise of more than one application, and you will find yourself mixing and matching

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,670
various types in a single system.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,470
For example, many web apps have in addition to the main application, also a service that run continuously

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:00,420
and performs maintenance tasks such as removing old data records, monitoring various processes and

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,930
so on.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,099
This is quite common and you will probably encounter this type of systems in your job.
