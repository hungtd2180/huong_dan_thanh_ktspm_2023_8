00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,240
Services are quite similar to console applications with two important distinctions.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,850
They have no user interface at all as opposed to the command line window in the console application.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,520
And they are managed by a service manager, which is a feature of the operating system that manages

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,480
the services.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,330
In Windows there is one service manager, while on Linux there are a handful you can choose from.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,280
The service manager starts and stops the services and also monitors their activity.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,490
Since services cannot ask the user about their behaviors, they will usually have a configuration file

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,380
containing the required parameters.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,230
Services are used for long running processes such as monitoring folder on the disk when no user intervention

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,100
is required.
