00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,170
Console applications or command line applications, often called CLI, are applications that run inside

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,150
the command line of the operating system.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,450
These applications have few common characteristics.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,880
They don't have any fancy UI.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,310
The only thing the end user sees are the lines of text displayed in the command line window.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,340
They require some level of technical knowledge.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,880
Console applications are triggered by typing a command in clear text, often with some parameters.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,200
Normal end users who are accustomed to point and click applications will have a hard time working with

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,430
these applications.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,130
They usually have a very limited interaction with the user, if at all.

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,050
In most cases, the console application might present some questions to the user in order to configure

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,480
its behavior, and then we'll start running.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,900
This configuration can be set also via command line parameters.

14
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,720
They can trigger long running process as well as execute very short focused actions.

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,790
Console applications are used mainly for executing long running processes that do not interact with

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:08,390
the end user and short focused actions, such as exporting data that should be used by specially trained

17
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,380
power users.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,750
It's important to note that the fact the application is a console application does not change anything

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,420
to its architecture or the architecture patterns and practices apply also to console applications.
