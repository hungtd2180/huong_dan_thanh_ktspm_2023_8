1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,440
Webops is probably the most common application type nowadays.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,270
Second, maybe only to web API.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,120
Web apps, also known as websites are basically the way the internet worked since its inception.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,410
With web apps.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,370
There is a web server, usually more than one, and a web browser.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,190
Those two communicate with each other via Http protocol, although other protocols can also be used,

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,540
the browser sends an Http request for the server asking for a resource.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,630
The resource in this case is an HTML page which gets returned to the browser, which in turn renders

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,010
it for the end user.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,160
Almost always, the HTML page will use JavaScript code for implementing logic in the browser and CSS

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,920
files for the visual design of the page.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,520
Web apps are best for systems that require user interface for end user user initiated actions.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,460
Meaning the user is the one making the request to do something such as viewing order, data saving username

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:03,300
and so on large scale with a large number of users and a lot of data, short focused action as opposed

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,739
to long running processes.

16
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,350
For example, web apps are not a good fit for a process that should crunch billions of numbers and produce

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,370
business intelligence.

18
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,370
For this, there are other kinds of applications.

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,420
As we discussed earlier, Web apps work in a request response model, which is perhaps the most important

20
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,310
aspect of them.

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,420
As a rule of thumb, if the system you are working on can be described as a request response application,

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,790
then you are probably looking at a web app.
