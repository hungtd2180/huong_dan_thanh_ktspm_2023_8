1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,500
The last and the most important section in the architectural document is a component drilldown section.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:12,380
This section describes the components that take part in the whole architecture as described in the architecture

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,370
overview section.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,170
This is the longest section by far.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,500
There is no actual limit to the length of this section, and I've created documents in which this section

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,240
alone was more than 100 pages.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,810
It's not that this is the recommended length.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,520
Ten pages can also be enough.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,040
It's just a function of the number of components and the level of drilldown that needs to be reached.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,770
The audience of this section is a development team.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,810
If the QA lead also wants to take a look, she is welcome to do so, but it's not necessary.

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,930
In some rare situations, some management folks would also like to take a look, but chances are that

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,640
after a few pages they will understand they have more important things to do and will leave it.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,760
So what are the contents of this section?

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,170
Well, this section goes through the various components depicted in the architecture overview and describes

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,780
them in length for each component.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,840
There should be four subsections in the document.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,600
First, the role of the component in the architecture.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,390
This is basically a short recap of the description found in the architecture overview section.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,880
Second, the technology stack.

21
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:24,300
This subsection should describe in detail what technologies will be used in developing the component.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,120
This subsection should first lay out the various parts in the component that the technology should be

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,630
selected.

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,530
For example, data store back end and front end.

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,940
And then for each one of them, the selected technology should be described.

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,740
Now, let's be honest here.

27
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,250
Technology stack selection is one of the most heated topics in the software world.

28
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,910
We already discussed the problems you should expect when trying to decide on the stack that will be

29
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,030
used in the system.

30
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:58,770
For this reason, it is extremely important that the technology stack subsection will be extremely detailed

31
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,940
and even more important, include the rationale behind the selection.

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,060
For example, when discussing the data store, if the decision is to go with NoSQL database such as

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,630
Mongo, it should be clear why this decision was made.

34
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,420
Reasons such as expected data structure, developers, experience, performance and ease of development

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,560
are all legitimate reasons, and they must appear in this section.

36
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,650
In addition, it's even better to explicitly compare MongoDB to other relational databases such as SQL

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,740
Server and explain in detail what are the pros and cons of each alternative and why the decision was

38
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,280
made.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,230
Now note that you don't have to go into this level of detail for every component.

40
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,670
If you made this process for the first component and the decision is valid for the same reasons.

41
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,740
Also, for other components, you can refer the readers to the selection process described in the first

42
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,060
component, and there is no need to copy paste the same section over and over.

43
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,080
The next subsection is a components architecture.

44
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,380
This section describes the inner architecture of the component.

45
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,930
It complements the architecture overview that describes the bigger picture by going into each and every

46
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,290
component and detailing what exactly it should do and how.

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,990
Remember all the architectural patterns we discussed earlier, the anti-pattern, the dependency injection,

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,490
stateless and all the rest?

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,740
This is where you are going to use it.

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,640
Start with describing the API of the component if there is any.

51
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't be afraid of detailing the actual methods of the API.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,360
It will make the development much easier and faster.

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,410
I usually include a table that describes all that is needed to know about the API, its role URL response

54
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,850
codes and comments.

55
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,400
It proves to be a great technique when working with the developers as they already know how the component

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,450
exposes itself and sets the context for the rest of the architecture.

57
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,950
Describe in detail the role of every layer up to the method level.

58
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,810
This will help the developers fully understand the role of the layers and what should and shouldn't

59
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,710
be in it.

60
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,020
If there are important considerations that should be taken into account, mention them here.

61
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,390
For example, if the business layer or BLE should take advantage of a dependency injection mechanism

62
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,570
in its constructor.

63
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,030
Mention it here.

64
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,010
The bottom line here is simple.

65
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,720
Be as detailed as possible and use as much visualizations as possible.

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,310
And that will make yours and the developer's life much easier later.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,330
The last subsection is development instructions.

68
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,560
This is usually a small subsection, no more than half page containing bulleted list of concrete development

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,550
instructions.

70
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,040
These instructions should point out specific guidelines that are not part of the architecture but still

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,240
relevant for the developers.

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,960
For example, usage of specific library for specific tasks or making sure the API is documented in a

73
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,500
format that makes it usable by tools such as swagger.

74
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,000
It's important to keep this list short, concise and very practical.

75
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,650
Avoid discussing patterns and theories here.

76
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,940
This.

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,420
Do.

78
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,590
Don't list nothing else.

79
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,080
Again, as with all the sections discussed here, you will find a complete fully functional architecture

80
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,810
document at the end of the of the next section where we will discuss a real world case study and build

81
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,050
its architecture together.

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,210
You will see this section and be able to see exactly what it looks like.

83
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,710
So with that, we conclude the architecture document section.

84
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,960
This document is a center of the architectural work, although not the only thing you will do.

85
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,550
It's extremely important.

86
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,960
This document will include all the insights produced while working on the architecture.

87
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,180
This will help you in the future for justifying decisions that we made earlier in the process.

88
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,800
Always try to get into your audience mind.

89
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,440
Write the executive summary for the management and target the components.

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,060
Drill down to the developers.

91
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,790
This way the document will be what it should be, the cornerstone and foundation of the system.
