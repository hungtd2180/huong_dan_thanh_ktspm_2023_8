1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,290
So what is the goal of the architectural document?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,029
Why do we have to invest so much time carefully crafting such a comprehensive document?

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,810
Well, that's a very good question, and let's try to answer it.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,880
First and foremost, the architectural document is a foundation of the development efforts of the system.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,790
It describes what should be developed and how.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,770
As a rule of thumb, no lines of code should be created before the development team read through the

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,180
architecture document and made sure they fully understand what should be done and how.

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,950
The document outlines the technology stack and the various components and services that comprise the

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,860
system and how do they communicate with each other.

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,210
Without this knowledge, the development team will have no idea what should be developed.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,160
When following the document, the team will be able to develop a well thought of fully documented,

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
fast, secure, reliable and easy to maintain system.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,540
This cannot be accomplished when such a document is not present.

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,870
So this is the first and the main goal of the document.

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,080
But actually there is more as we will see in this section.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,900
The document also describes the functional and non-functional requirements.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,220
In many cases, this is the first time such requirements are expressed on writing, and this is the

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,190
first time the customer is able to see it in formal form.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,840
For the team, this is a great opportunity to validate the requirements and make sure together with

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,810
the customer that he gets what he actually wants.

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,390
So these are the goals of the document.

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,390
Let's move on and talk about some more aspects of it.
