1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,560
The next section in the document is executive summary.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,130
Its length is usually a few pages, usually no more than three.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:13,370
And its audience, as you can guess, is mainly management, meaning the CEO, CTO and project manager.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,310
The executive summary presents the architecture designed for the system in a very high level that allows

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,520
non-technical people to understand what is basically going on.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,250
Now why do we need executive summary?

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,650
After all, the document itself describes the architecture in great length and contains all the details

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,220
about it.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,290
Why do we need a dedicated section that reiterates an already existing information?

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,040
Well, here is the answer.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,920
Remember that one of the main goals of the architectural document is to make the management confident

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,360
in your work and make them feel they made the right choice working with you.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,820
Of course, if the CEO will read all the architectural document, he will be very impressed and will

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,320
definitely like your work.

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,960
Same goes for the CTO and project manager.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,880
Problem is, they won't do it.

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,360
The managers are usually very busy non-technical persons.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,660
They will have no idea what are the intricate differences between Rest API and Signal R, and they couldn't

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,400
care less about stateless or dependency injection.

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,590
They are business oriented people and they want to know the system is in good hands.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,550
Yours.

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,370
So if you will expect them to actually read the document, which is a very long and technical one,

23
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,630
they will simply stop at the middle and will have no idea what they just read.

24
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,490
They won't feel better about working with you and they definitely won't be more confident about it.

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,340
And this is where the executive summary fits in.

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,280
The goal of the executive summary is to provide a very high level view of the architecture using simple

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,950
words and not too many technical terms, thus boosting the management confidence in working with you.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,410
It should convey the broad idea and concepts of the architecture, but should refrain from using too

29
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,030
low level technical details.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,970
Try to get into the mind of your target audience here.

31
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,940
This is someone who has a lot on his shoulders, has no time for reading long technical documents and

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,690
should be satisfied quite quickly with the solution presented.

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,449
You should write the executive summary specifically for this person.

34
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,510
Now a few tips for the executive summary.

35
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,370
First, use charts and diagrams.

36
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,390
They make a big impression and are really useful in creating confidence.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,920
Usually you will already have a diagram depicting the high level architecture of the system.

38
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,240
Use it also in the executive summary.

39
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,360
Second, the actual writing of the executive summary should take place after writing the architecture

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,410
related sections.

41
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,470
Remember, the executive summary summarizes the architecture and it cannot summarize something that

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,700
wasn't created yet.

43
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,610
Now, don't get confused here.

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,650
The executive summary appears before the architecture sections, but is written after them.

45
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,150
Third, use well known technical terms and use them separately.

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,420
You can mention microservices cloud or scalability.

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,130
Do not mention low level terms such as dependency injection or signal.

48
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,130
Fourth, do not repeat yourself.

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,730
The document already describes the background and the requirements.

50
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,220
Do not write them again in the executive summary.

51
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,210
This will just exhaust the reader and will make him appreciate you less.

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,470
Remember, readers of the executive summary have limited time and patience.

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,970
Do not challenge them.

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,120
Okay, so now that we are done with the executive summary, let's continue to the next section.
