1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,160
Our next section in the architectural document is architectural overview.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,660
This section is usually a long one and can reach to up to ten pages.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,170
Its audience is the development team and the QA lead.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,210
The architectural overview section provides a high level view of the systems architecture.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,150
Its goal is to present the architecture to the team and to explain its structure and logic.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,610
This section does not deep dive into the specifics of any component of the architecture.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,890
This is saved for the next section, but it lays the foundation of the architecture and provides the

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,130
context in which the various components will work.

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,740
This section has usually three parts.

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,000
The first part of this section gives a general description of the designed architecture.

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,670
This part lays the foundation of the architecture by describing its type and the reasoning behind it

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,250
and the major non-functional requirements, for example.

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,060
This part will explain that the system will be, for example, a web based system and will outline the

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,780
reasons for this choice.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,290
It will describe the major architectural pattern used such as microservices, rest API, stateless and

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,100
so on.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,950
In addition, it can be stated in this part that this application must have an average performance of

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,750
50 requests per second.

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,760
It should be clear that this part lays the foundation for the rest of the architecture that will be

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,080
built on top of it.

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,770
The second part is a high level diagram of the architecture.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,650
This diagram describes the general concepts of the architecture using the various services, data stores

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,110
and interactions so that the reader will comprehend what the various components of the architecture

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,030
are and what is the responsibility of each one.

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,450
As mentioned before, there is not a single formal standard for visualizing architectural concepts,

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,730
and I'm using PowerPoint for that.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,970
Let's look at a typical architecture diagram taken almost as is from one of the recent architectural

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,890
documents I've been working on.

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,910
As you can see, this diagram contains three types of elements services depicted as black rectangles,

30
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:08,550
interactions displayed as arrows and data stores represented as cylinders.

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,700
The diagram shows the various parts of the architecture.

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,150
It displays the services that together assemble the system, the role of each one, where they place

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,940
their data and the interactions between them.

34
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,480
Don't worry if you are not familiar with every term in this diagram.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,770
For example, we did not discuss the Mqtt protocol.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,250
This is a specialized protocol used extensively by Iot devices but is less common in more traditional

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,240
applications.

38
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,240
When the team will see this diagram, the developers will understand what are the components involved

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,550
in the system and why they are there.

40
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,070
This will be extremely helpful later when we will deep dive into each component and the developers will

41
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,150
already be familiar with the component and its role in the grand scheme.

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,510
It's important to note that the diagram is a logic one there is no mentioning of servers, networks,

43
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,960
switches, network drives, load balancer and such.

44
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:10,170
This is a strictly logic diagram displaying the logic components of the architecture do not mix physical

45
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,060
hardware with logic architecture.

46
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,510
The third and last part of the overview section is the walkthrough of the diagram.

47
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,760
In this part you will describe the various parts of the diagram and the role verbally.

48
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,040
This part walks through the diagram and explains each and every component in it.

49
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:35,880
It describes in simple words what is the exact role of the component, what is its functionality and

50
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,060
what interactions it has with each and every other component.

51
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,430
In addition, it describes the data that is stored in the components data store, if there is one.

52
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,730
This part is extremely important since a diagram cannot convey all the intricacies of the architecture.

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,100
It's important to include any logic details that you think will be relevant, such as the components,

54
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,580
users expected load, future extensions and more.

55
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,970
You will see a complete example of this part in the architecture document.

56
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,880
You will get on the next section of this course.

57
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,490
Now let's talk about technology stack.

58
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,350
What is the exact section in the document where the technology stack should be described?

59
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,350
Is it here in the overview section or in the next section that deep dives into the various components?

60
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,340
Well, the answer, as you might expect, is it depends.

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,800
If the system has a single technology stack and all its components will be built using this stack.

62
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,130
Then the overview section is a great place to write about it.

63
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,440
On the other hand, if the stack is different between the various components, it should be described

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,650
per component, since in modern systems there are usually more than one technology stack used.

65
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,900
I describe this part in detail in the next section, so let's drill down.
