1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,810
The first section is a background section.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,180
This is a short section one pager.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,290
Max and its target audience is all the team and management members.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,870
In this section you should describe briefly the system you are working on from a business point of view.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,010
The section should describe, at minimum, the main role of the system.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,800
For example, managing the HR of the company.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,600
If it replaces an old system, describe why the old one should be replaced.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,350
For example.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,760
It requires too much maintenance and is based on outdated technologies.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,610
And what is the expected business impact?

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:41,420
For example, streamlining HR tasks and increasing HR employees productivity by as much as 20%.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,960
Now, the section might seem a bit out of place.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,480
After all, we can safely assume that team members are already familiar with the system they are working

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,960
on, and this section will have nothing new to say about it.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,490
So why is it here?

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,180
Nevertheless, the section is incredibly important and for a few reasons.

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,660
First, it displays your point of view of the system.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,750
If someone has some comments to make on it or if an error was found, it's better to have an opportunity

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,820
to correct it as soon as possible.

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,380
And the first section is a great place for that.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,980
After all, all the other sections build on this one and if it's not accurate, they should probably

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,910
be fixed too.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,160
Second, it shows the management that you did your homework and that you are geared towards business

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,290
results and not just a tech geek.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,990
This distinction is super important and gives confidence to the CEO and project manager that you are

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,510
someone they can talk to and will not drown them.

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,460
In a confusing techie lingo.

28
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,080
This is the reason this section should not have any technical details or architectural terms.

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,640
No microservices, no programming languages, no clouds, nothing.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,740
Just a simple text describing what the system should do from the end user point of view.
