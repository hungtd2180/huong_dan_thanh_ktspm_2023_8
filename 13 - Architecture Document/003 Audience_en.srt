1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,200
Let's talk about the architectural documents.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,850
Audience Who are we writing this document for?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,910
Who is the intended audience for our document?

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,400
Well, the answer might surprise you a little.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,730
While you may think the document is targeted only for the developers.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,580
It's real audience is almost everyone involved in the system, including the project manager, the CTO,

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,750
if there is any, the QA leader, and of course, the developers.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,580
The only difference is what does any team member gain from the document?

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,180
Let's go through the various roles of the teams and explain.

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,510
So let's begin with the development team.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,040
We already discussed the use of the document and explained the document out, the basic concepts of

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,680
the system, the technology stack, the components and the services and the way they communicate with

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,460
each other.

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,020
So it's clear why the development team is an audience for our document.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,020
Next, let's talk about management.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:59,990
In management, I target mainly the project manager, the CTO, and in smaller organizations, even

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,050
the CEO.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,500
So what does management has to do with the architecture document?

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,300
Simply put, the management will use the document to ensure the team is in good hands.

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,560
When the project manager will see the requirements are fully detailed in the architectural document,

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,170
she will know you fully grasp the essence of the system and as a result that she can trust you.

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,900
When the CTO will go through the executive summary and will see you are using best practices and modern

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,160
technologies and patterns.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,350
Even if you won't understand every word in it, you will still feel confident in working with you.

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,900
Even the CEO, when he will see the system.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,410
Design is geared towards business goals and not architectural goals.

27
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,440
He will know the right choice was made in working with you.

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,720
Now, usually management will not go through the whole document, but only its first sections.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,860
But that enough.

30
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,870
They don't need to be fluent in all the technical and architectural details and frankly, they don't

31
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,860
have time for this.

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,860
For this reason, the sections targeted mainly for management will appear first in the document, as

33
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,600
you will see later.

34
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,850
And what about QA?

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,600
Well, the lead should also read this document.

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,360
The reason for that is that by reading it, the QA lead can begin preparations for the testing infrastructure

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,240
when performing integration tests and load tests, they should be relevant infrastructure in place.

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,320
There are servers that should be installed and prepared testing tools that should be configured and

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,330
sometimes there is some coding involved.

40
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,670
The architecture document will give the QA lead the essential information she needs to start preparing

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,220
this infrastructure by learning about technologies used in the system and the number and type of services

42
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,780
and matching infrastructure can be built, thus shortening the project schedule.

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,760
So as you can see, almost all the team members have something to gain from the architecture document,

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,770
and we as architects must try our best to make it available for anyone interested.

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,660
We will begin shortly to talk about the document structure and then I'll make it clear what section

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,670
is relevant for which audience.
