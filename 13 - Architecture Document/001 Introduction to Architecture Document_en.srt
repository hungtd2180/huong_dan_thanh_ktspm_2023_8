00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,830
Welcome to the architectural document section.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,050
In this section, we will explore the most important product of the architect's work, the architectural

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,830
document.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,290
In this document, the architect describes the architecture that was designed as well as the various

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,640
requirements functional and non-functional.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,090
The technology stack and more.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,340
In fact, the architectural document includes almost all the concepts and information discussed in this

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,630
course up until now.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,580
The architecture document is a cornerstone of the application development, and no development should

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,470
begin before an architectural document is created and the developers fully grasped its contents.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,510
In this section, we will deep dive into this document, understand what its goals are, who is the

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,120
audience and what is its structure.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,150
Remember that this course has a very special bonus, a complete full blown, ready to use architectural

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,750
document which you can download and use as a template for your architecture.

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,210
You can find this document in the resources of the next section where we will discuss a case study for

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,570
the architecture process.

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,880
So remember, even if you feel you don't fully understand the role of each section in the document,

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,540
you will be able to see it in its full context in the actual document.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,470
Let's go.
