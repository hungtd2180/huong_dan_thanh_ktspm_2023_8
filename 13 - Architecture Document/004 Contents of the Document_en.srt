00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,820
One of the hottest debates in the architect community is the format of the architecture document.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,820
There are some standards that are sometimes used when writing the architecture document that define

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,950
various kinds of charts and diagrams to make the architecture easier to understand and implement.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,340
One of the most famous standards is UML.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,410
UML is defined as a modeling language that helps visualize the design of a system.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,680
It consists of software concepts such as activities, components and interactions, as well as diagrams

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,250
visualizing the system design such as class diagram and use case diagram.

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,890
However, I am usually not using UML in my architectural documents.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,170
The reason for that is quite simple.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,210
Remember the documents Audience.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,960
Good.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,180
Most of the audience will not be familiar with UML and will have no idea what the meaning of the various

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,380
diagrams and terms.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,660
And if the document contains a lot of this stuff, you will find yourself wasting a lot of time explaining

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,510
in plain English or whatever your local language is.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,460
What did you mean and what should actually be developed?

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,920
In my experience, after designing hundreds of system, the most effective architecture document is

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,020
the most simple one, meaning just use plain English.

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,450
Describe in simple words what the design of the system is.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,450
Don't use too many buzzwords all over the document.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,030
Try to get into the mind of your readers.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,280
Will they understand what you are trying to say?

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,700
Now, sometimes you will want to visualize various concepts of the design.

24
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,900
You will see that in the document we will discuss later in this course.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,530
For this, use the software you have in hand.

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,370
It can be PowerPoint, Visio, Apple keynote, whatever suits you.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Just make sure the visualization is clear and concise and of a high quality and not cluttered with unnecessary

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,510
items and shapes.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,330
Now, if your client specifically wants UML diagram is a document, and I had only one such a client

30
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,730
in my whole career simply go through some UML tutorials and create the diagrams using tools such as

31
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,240
Visio.

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,770
If you are fluent with PowerPoint, you can quite easily use it also for these diagrams.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,920
So to summarize, the architecture document should be simple Use plain English to describe the requirements,

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,300
concepts and design and use your favorite charting tools for visualizations.
