1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,250
So what is the structure of the architectural document?

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,400
What are the sections and topics it must have in order to be as effective as possible?

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,640
Let's review the various parts of the document before deep diving into each one of them in the next

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,510
lectures.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,000
First background.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,160
This is where you, the architect, writes down the role and motivation for the new system from the

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,270
business point of view.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,830
Notice there are no technical or architectural content in this section.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,000
Next, the requirements.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,420
This is a very important part of the document as the requirements dictate much of the architecture.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,930
After the requirements comes the executive summary.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,200
This is the part that CXOs will read as well as the project manager, QA leader and other non development

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,370
related functions.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,160
This is usually the last section to be read by them and it should give a high level overview of the

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,910
solution.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,640
Next is the architecture overview.

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,320
In this section, we will lay out the high level architecture painting the big picture of the solution

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,349
and following the architecture overview are the components.

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,099
Drill down.

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,260
This is where most of the work is done, and that's the core of the document.

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,370
It contains a practical, detailed architecture of the various components in the architecture, including

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,080
technology, stack, architectural details and implementation instructions.

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,150
So let's examine each section in detail.
