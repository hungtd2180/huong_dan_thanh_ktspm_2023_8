1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,490
Another important aspect of the architect's job is to know how to speak to different persons in the

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,450
organization.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,280
Here is the rule of thumb.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,350
Always keep in mind what is the thing that really matters to the person you are talking to.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,820
If you can adapt your language to the best interest of the person you are talking to, you will be able

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,230
to achieve much more.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,120
By the way, this rule is right not only for architects, of course, but for anyone who tries to achieve

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,920
something from someone.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,660
Let's look at some examples.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,180
Here is Sophie, the project manager.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,970
Sophie cares only for the project success.

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,000
She doesn't care what technology will be used or how amazing the architecture is.

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,730
When you talk to her about your plans for the architecture, always emphasize how it will contribute

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,990
to the project success.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,540
Avoid sentences like This is the latest and greatest pattern and we will be the first to test it out.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,640
We can write a blog post about it.

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,520
This sentence will only frighten her and she will immediately imagine how this untested technology will

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,430
cause delays and compromises down the road.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,030
Instead, try something along the lines of this new technology can help us write the code twice as fast

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,580
so we can cut our schedule and budget accordingly.

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,040
This is a language a project manager understands, and she will be more than happy to help you, assuming

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,520
you are right.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,270
Of course.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,390
Now let's look at Dave, the team leader.

25
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,200
Dave is a hard core geek and he just loves programming.

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,270
He spent at least one hour every night reading through technical blog posts and he always up to date

27
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,700
with the recent developments in the software industry.

28
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,920
If you want to bring Dave on board and make him a strong proponent of your architecture, talk to him

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,340
using a technical language.

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,050
Tell him, Listen, Dave, have you heard of the latest Angular version?

31
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,370
We are going to use it or, you know, function as a service are pretty cool.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,920
What do you say we will give it a try in this project?

33
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,420
Most chances they will be more than happy to work with you when approached this way.

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,030
The last person we will look at is Shelly the CEO.

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,150
Shelly is a very business oriented person and she always looks for the financial bottom line.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,560
If you want to explain her, what are the advantages of the architecture you are working on?

37
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,820
Never mention technical buzzwords.

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,760
Shelly is the kind of person that when he microservices or caching or even Java, she immediately loses

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,410
interest and stops listening.

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,050
However, if you will tell her this, the architecture I've designed will ensure the continuity of the

41
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,400
business and will be able to cope with the high loads expected during Black Friday sales.

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,630
Then you got her.

43
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,720
She will listen to you and will appreciate the work you are doing.

44
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,670
So to recap, always keep in mind what really matters to the person you are talking to.

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,040
Try to be in his shoes, not yours, and then show him how your work contributes to his interests.
