Welcome to the third section of this course, the architect's Mindset.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,440
In this section, we will discuss one of the most important aspects of being an architect, which is

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,030
the architect's mindset.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,790
If your current job is a technical one, such as a developer or a team leader, then you are probably

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,630
thinking about the work you do from a coding and development point of view.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,180
But as you will see in this section, this is not always the most appropriate point of view for an architect.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,370
The architect should often make a decision based on other factors which are sometimes foreign for a

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,049
developer.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,400
But in order to be a really good architect, you have to adapt yourself to the new point of view, which

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,880
will make you a real asset for the organization.

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,200
So let's talk about this new mindset.
