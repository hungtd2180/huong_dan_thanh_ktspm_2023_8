1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,620
The biggest mindset change you have to make in order to be a good architect is to understand the business

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,210
your client or employer is involved in.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,370
Now, this might sound trivial.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,420
Supposedly everyone in the organization knows what the company is doing, right?

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,690
Well, that's usually only partly true.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,270
I'm sure every Microsoft employee knows that Microsoft develops software such as Windows and Office

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,510
and that it has one of the largest public clouds in the world.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,960
I'm also sure that every Amazon employee knows that Amazon sells a huge selection of items from books

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,980
to fresh food.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,410
But that is not enough.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,790
And let me tell you a story.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,660
A couple of years ago, I was approached by a company in the Iot field.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,260
It was a medium sized company with about 600 employees worldwide.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,650
I was familiar with this company and I knew vaguely what they were doing, but I knew it wasn't enough.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,150
So I grabbed my PC and began reading.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,340
The day after we had the meeting, to their surprise, I was able to tell them about their founders,

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,500
their line of products, their revenue and profit.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,780
And bear in mind, the company was not publicly traded at that time.

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,690
Competitors and so on.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,890
This blew them out of the water and we agreed to work together on this very day.

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,170
But I'm not telling you this story to teach you marketing tactics, although it's a very effective one.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,130
The real important lesson here is that in order to be of a real value to the organization, you have

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,130
to have a deep understanding of the organization's business.

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,310
You have to know what keeps the CEO awake at night.

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,000
You have to understand what its weaknesses and strengths are.

26
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,930
Who are they competing with and what is their growth strategy?

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,580
Only after you understand all this, you can start talking architecture and technology.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,050
One of the most common mistakes made by architects is that they are looking at the systems they are

29
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,340
working on as a stand alone system, isolated from the rest of their organization.

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,080
But it can't work that way.

31
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,450
Every organization is a living organism with a lot of moving parts, and the architect must understand

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,600
how the system integrates into this living organism.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,330
And what role does this part play?

34
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,630
So to recap, remember, always understand the business before you begin working on the architecture.
