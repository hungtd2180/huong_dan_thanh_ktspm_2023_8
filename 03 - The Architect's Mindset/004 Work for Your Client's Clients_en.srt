00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,270
One of the most important aspects of the architect's work is to identify who the client is.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,970
Now, that might sound a little stupid.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,290
Of course I know who my client is.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,580
It's the one who pays me.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,370
Well, yes, but also no.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,690
Let me explain.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,060
In almost every organization, the architect is part of the IT department.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,810
It doesn't matter whether the architect is an employee of the organization or a consultant who works

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,770
with the organization.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,660
He is hired by the IT people.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,060
But the IT guys have clients, and these are the end users of the application.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,370
And these are the guys you should work for.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,780
What does it mean?

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,770
It means that your mindset should be geared towards your client's client.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,110
It means that with every decision you make, you must ask yourself what will be the effect of this decision

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,610
on your client's client?

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,950
It means that the comfort of your client's client is prioritized over the comfort of your client.

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,430
Let's see an example.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,340
One of the recent systems I worked on was a system that displayed data based on the telemetry received

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,790
from remote stations.

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,769
One of the dilemmas we had is what to do when the database storing the telemetry is offline.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,410
This was a scenario we had to consider since the IT department could not commit to a concrete SLA of

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,250
the database.

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,100
The solution we came up with was to display a clear message to the end user that there is a problem

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,410
with the system and ask him to try again later.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,150
This is quite a common behavior for such a scenario.

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,000
However, the client asked whether we can find an intermediate solution that will allow him to view

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,250
the data but not make any modifications.

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,430
We thought about it long and hard and came up with a solution that made our architecture much more complicated.

30
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,500
We have introduced a dedicated caching layer that duplicated the data and was used when the database

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,430
was offline.

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,360
My client, which was a development team, worked much harder.

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,120
But my client's client, the end user, was extremely satisfied with this solution and praised our willingness

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,340
to help him and to think outside the box.

35
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,390
Now, you might say that working with a client is a system analyst job and not the architect.

36
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,460
This is usually correct, but sometimes a project is carried out without a system analyst on board,

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,080
and even if there is one, you still have to understand the client's environment in order to make the

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,440
best decisions for him.

39
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,870
In this case, the architect does not replace the system analyst, but it's a very good idea to join

40
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,840
her for some meetings and to meet the clients personally.

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,730
Sometimes you will see that your client, the IT department, does not view the client as a client.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,670
They will refer to the end users as colleagues, co-workers, or even those annoying guys that always

43
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,570
have demands.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,470
In this case, your work might be a bit harder.

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,720
You have to not only change your mindset, but also them.
