1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,360
After we have understood the business and learned all what there is to learn about it, it's time to

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,700
look at the specific system we are going to work on.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,880
The first thing to look at are the system's goals.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,740
Now it's important to note we are not talking here about what the system should do.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,030
These are not goals.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,290
These are requirements.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,110
And it's important to distinguish one from the other.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,480
When talking about goals, we are talking about the effect the system will have on the organization.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,580
This effect can be almost anything, but it should be clear how this will affect the bottom line of

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,630
the organization.

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,720
The reason we should be fully aware of the system's goals is that as architects we must always think

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,870
about the big picture.

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,320
We must know what is the environment our system is going to be operating in and what are the main tasks

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,520
it's going to tackle.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,340
Usually the client should tell you what the system's goals are, but this is not always the case.

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,980
I once had a client that asked me to design the architecture of a specific system for him.

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,210
The system specifications were clear.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,600
The various services and screens were already defined and it looked like an easy task.

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,880
However, when we began discussing the place of the system in the organization, we found out almost

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,340
no one was going to use the system as it is.

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,920
There were many other systems which performed similar tasks, albeit in a less comfortable manner,

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,170
but the users were already used to those systems and there was simply not a strong enough incentive

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,790
for them to move to the new one.

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,880
We ended up changing almost all of the system's scope and functionality, and the final product was

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,300
a much smaller but much more focused and effective system.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,440
Let's take a look at some examples of goals first.

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,530
New air system For a product oriented company, the goal is to streamline the recruitment process,

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,600
thus attracting better candidates.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,490
This, of course, will help the company build better products more quickly, thus growing the revenue.

30
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,700
New Information System for reporting and mapping criminal incidents in the city.

31
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,250
The goal here is to improve the police response time for every incident and to encourage new residents

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,660
to migrate to the city.

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,300
Of course, there is also a hidden agenda here.

34
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,229
This system will help the mayor to be re-elected in the next elections.

35
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,580
Next, mobile application for flash sales is the organization.

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,120
Here is a small and young startup with only three developers.

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,830
The goal here is twofold.

38
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,360
One, earn money as fast as possible and the to attract investors.

39
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,160
Okay, So we've talked about the system goals.

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,470
And let's go on to another important aspect of the system, which must be on the architect's mind.
