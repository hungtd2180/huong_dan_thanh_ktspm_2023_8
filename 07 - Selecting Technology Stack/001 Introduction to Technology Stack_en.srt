00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,110
Welcome to the Technology stack section.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,180
In this section, we will discuss one of the most important and loaded tasks of the architect, and

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,310
that is selecting the technology stack of the system.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,400
The selected technology stack will determine what languages, platforms and tools will be used during

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,630
system development and what are the skills required from the development team.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,510
This decision is important for two reasons.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,840
One, it's irreversible.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,560
Once you've decided to use a specific platform and work has begun on this platform, you can't reverse

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,710
it.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,730
It's not possible to decide three months into development that actually we prefer another platform.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,380
Such a decision will result in a complete rewrite of the system and a substantial delay in schedule.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,140
There are some architectural patterns that allow some kind of flexibility in the technology stack selection,

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,730
notably microservices.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,690
But even there, it's not a good idea to switch platforms between each service.

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:00,540
Reason number two Decisions like that are often loaded with emotions and are made on a non rational

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,290
basis.

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,519
You will encounter situations where the development team would like to do a specific platform because

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,600
it's new, sexy and the team across the corridor already uses it.

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,950
It won't matter that this technology is inferior for the specific task in hand.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,600
They will still want it.

21
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:22,200
So this decision has to be made with clear mind, must be heavily documented, and be a group effort.

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,450
And not only yours, the architect.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,520
In this section we will discuss technology, stack alternatives for the front end, back end and data

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,090
store.

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,800
For each alternative, we will give a little background and discuss its pros and cons.

26
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,420
I hope this section will help you make an informed decision about the technology stack in your system.
