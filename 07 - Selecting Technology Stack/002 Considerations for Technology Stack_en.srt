00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,970
When selecting the technology stack, there are some considerations that must be taken into account

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,660
in order to ensure the best platform will be used in these systems.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,610
Let's look at these considerations.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,910
One can perform the required tasks.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,910
Well, this might sound trivial, but it's still important.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,620
When looking at a specific platform.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,060
We must ensure this platform can actually perform what is required from it.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,430
For example, if one of the requirements is to support cross platform deployment, it's important to

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,820
make sure the technology we are looking at is actually cross platform.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,700
Or another example, if the requirements state that the system's user interface must be web based,

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,150
there is no point in exploring rich clients platforms.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,580
Second Community.

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,920
You always want to make sure there is a large active community which discusses the platform and can

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,450
provide support when needed.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,760
This way you know you won't be left alone in the dark when encountering problems and questions, and

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,680
you can seek help in this community.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,870
The best place to look for this community is in.

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,190
Com.

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,060
If you are still not familiar with this amazing site, then time is now.

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,300
This is the largest developer oriented Q and A site which provides answers to almost any question regarding

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,200
development in every platform.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,200
The most brilliant developers are helping others here, and whatever your problem is, it's probably

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,810
already has been asked and answered here.

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,860
So go to Stack Overflow, click tags at the sidebar and look at the technology you are interested in.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,760
You will see a number near its name.

26
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,570
This number designates the number of questions on this technology.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,630
The larger the number, the more active the community.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,440
It's always a good idea to actually click the name of the tag and go to the platform's page.

29
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,740
There you can see when the last questions were asked.

30
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,970
This will give you some idea about how active the community is, not just how big it is.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,250
So if you see the last question was asked four days ago, it seems like the community is not very active.

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,260
This is a very simple and powerful way to find out the community size of the technology you are looking

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,740
at.

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,690
Third, popularity also seems a bit superficial.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,150
The popularity factor is quite important.

36
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,370
Unpopular platforms will usually lead to a small community, which will lead to a lack of support.

37
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,350
The best way to test the popularity of everything on the internet is by using Google Trends.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,120
So go to Google Trends and type the name of the platform you are interested in.

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,260
In this example, let's look at Angular and press Enter.

40
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,150
I always like to set the search for the past two years.

41
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,480
The default one year is often not enough to give perspective.

42
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,750
Here we see that the popularity of Angular is quite flat, so there is no decrease in its popularity,

43
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,370
but no increase either.

44
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,700
Now let's add React, its nemesis to the chart.

45
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,310
We see that React is on an upward trend and currently it's on par with Angular.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,400
And now let's add a jQuery.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,340
Here we see a reverse trend popularity of jQuery is decreasing, and that indicates that perhaps it's

48
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,090
not a good idea to base your web UI on it in a modern application.

49
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,240
So these are the three factors that must be taken into account when selecting technology stack.

50
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,100
There are more factors that relate to the development team and organization and we will discuss them

51
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,550
later.

52
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,090
But these are the factors that reflect the platform's impact and potential.

53
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,500
And now let's go on and discuss the backend and service technology stack.
