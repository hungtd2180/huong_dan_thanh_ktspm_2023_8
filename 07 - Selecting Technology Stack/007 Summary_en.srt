00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,600
In this section, we discuss the technology stack selection process and divided it to back end, front

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,950
end and data store.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,380
I didn't try to declare a winner on each category, but rather to demonstrate what are the principles

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,810
that affect the selection and what are the parameters we should evaluate when making this selection?

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,510
I would like to emphasize again how important is a rational, educated selection and what is the impact

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,240
of selecting the wrong technology for the wrong reasons?

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,230
There are a lot of emotions in this discussion.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,640
You will tackle dev teams that won't be ready to hear about anything which is not dotnet even if it's

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,790
clearly not the right choice for the system.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,990
You will participate in heated discussions between Angular supporters and React supporters and you will

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,740
definitely be part of a meeting discussing NoSQL versus SQL from all the wrong reasons.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,230
My best advice is stay out of the line of fire.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,520
Bring to the table the rational voice backed by concrete numbers and factors.

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,720
Never get involved emotionally in such discussion.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,600
It will harm your architecture and more important, your reputation.

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,440
Believe me, after the system will be implemented successfully using the technologies you recommended,

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,910
no matter how angry they were at the beginning, they will be thanking you at the end.
