<p>Since the recording of this lecture, .NETCore has progressed dramatically.</p><p>While in the lecture I've argued that .NETCore is not "full baked" yet, it now reached a level of maturity Ifeel comfortable with.</p><p>As of now, .NETCore v3.0 is just around the corner, and it has all the features Imissed in early versions.</p><p>This makes .NET Core a viable, even recommended, platform for everyone who is considering .NETClassic as his or her platform of choice.</p><p>In fact, I'm so convinced about .NETCore capabilities, that I've used it extensively in the Case Study section later in this course.</p><p>So the bottom line is this - </p><p>Do not shy away from .NETCore, and you can use it with confidence.</p>
