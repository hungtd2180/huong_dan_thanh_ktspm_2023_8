00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,670
In this section, we talked about system architecture and the main aspects of it.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,650
Using the concepts we have learned in this section, wisely, you will be able to design system architecture

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,660
that ensures your system is fast, secure, reliable and easy to maintain.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,550
Note that it's extremely important to make the right choices as early as possible.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,620
Many concepts we have discussed in this section are difficult to change once made.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,930
For example, moving from rest API based messaging to queue based messaging will result in a rewrite

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,330
of at least some of the components of the system.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,680
So always try to make sure your decisions are as informed as possible.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,350
Also, note these concepts are not exclusive.

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,360
Of course there are more decisions that must be factored in and of course there are a lot more of work

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,920
to do than to choose the right logging and monitoring and to select the right messaging method.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,320
But the concepts discussed here are usually the most important ones and you will find yourself using

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,690
them in almost every system you will design.
