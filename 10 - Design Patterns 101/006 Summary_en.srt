00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,470
In this section, we discuss the design patterns we talked about for patterns, factory repository,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,630
facade and command.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,940
These patterns, when implemented correctly, will help you design software which is more consistent,

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,580
flexible, readable and easy to maintain.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,120
On the other hand, don't rush to implement all the patterns exist.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,820
One of the mistakes junior architects do is designing a patterns oriented architecture, which is an

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,530
architecture that tries to implement as many patterns as possible instead of keeping things simple.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,400
So don't do that either, and use only the patterns you really need in the resource document attached

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,210
to this lecture.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,280
There are some resources for learning more about the various design patterns and I highly recommend

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,330
going through them.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,310
I hope this section helped you understand the basics of design patterns and I hope you will find a real

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,390
value using them.
