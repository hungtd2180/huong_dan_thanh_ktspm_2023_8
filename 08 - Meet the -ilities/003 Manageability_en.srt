00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,700
As you can probably guess, manageability is the ability to manage the application.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,260
Now, what does it mean?

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,780
Simply put, it's the ability to know what's going on with the application at any given time and to

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,060
take actions that will improve its work.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,270
For example, a manageable application will constantly report its status to monitoring agents and let

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,820
them know when errors occur, when there is an exceptionally high load, when the ram is becoming dangerously

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,020
high and so on.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,780
The monitoring agents report this back to a management console and then a decision can be made either

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,090
automatically or by a human operator to take some action, such as retrying the process that caused

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,010
the error or adding resources to cope with the load and with the situation.

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:49,790
The best way to differentiate a manageable system from one that is not is by finding out who is the

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,460
one that reports problems.

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,860
If it's the end user, then the system is not manageable.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,770
And as a side effect, we have made your users a team which is bad on the other hand, if the system

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,190
itself report problems, the experience is much better.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,790
The system will find out a problem is going to occur.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,920
For example, a mass of request is received in a very short time and the response time degradates substantially.

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,500
As a result, the system alerts the monitoring agent about it and the operator decides to add more VMs

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,700
to support that load.

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,490
The end result is that the users don't even know there is a problem and the system is just humming along

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,180
happily.
