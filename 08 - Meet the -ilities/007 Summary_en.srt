00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,400
In this section, we discussed the highlights, the family of quality attributes of a system.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,580
We talked about the relationships between between non-functional requirements and these quality attributes

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,160
and explained that the quality attributes represent technical capabilities that stem from the non-functional

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,000
requirements.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:26,210
We described five common qualities scalability, manageability, modularity, extensibility and testability.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,790
I strongly recommend that each system you design will implement these ilities even if you are not sure

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,500
they are actually required in the system, they will probably be later in its lifespan.

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,990
I also recommend to take a look at the full list of the ilities in the Wikipedia page.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,280
Some of them are really relevant for a very specific kind of systems, but others might come in handy

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,750
for your system as well.
