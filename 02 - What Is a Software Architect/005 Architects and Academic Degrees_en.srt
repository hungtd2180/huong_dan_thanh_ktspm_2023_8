00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,820
Let's talk about architects and academic degrees.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,070
I'm often asked, what should I learn in university in order to be an architect?

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,110
Well, the answer is quite short.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,170
I'm not aware of any academic institution that has a degree geared towards software architecture.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,490
Of course, the usual computer science degree is always helpful, though not always mandatory, but

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,360
there is no specific degree that has to be taken in order to be an architect.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,420
There are some courses and certifications that deal with architecture such as TOGAF, but they are geared

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,020
more towards enterprise architecture rather than software architecture.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,570
So the bottom line is you don't have to have any specific formal education in order to be an architect.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,910
It's mainly a matter of experience.
