1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,290
So what is actually a software architect?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,000
What is his objective?

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,950
What is he actually doing?

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,570
Who is he working with?

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,120
Well, all these questions are great.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,500
But before we will answer them, let's discuss other types of architect.

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,100
The word architect in the software world is an overloaded one.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,350
There are quite a few types of architects.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:28,850
And let's take a look at the most common ones, which are infrastructure architect, software architect

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,610
and enterprise architect.

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,520
There are some more types of architects, but they are more of a niche and we want to talk about them.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,640
So let's see what those types of architects are.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,550
First, infrastructure architect.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,970
The infrastructure architect is responsible for designing the infrastructure of a given system.

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,720
And by infrastructure I mean all the non software related elements such as servers, virtual machines,

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,760
network storage, etcetera.

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:04,970
He is responsible for all these and also to make sure they work nicely with the system developed.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,950
The infrastructure architect should be familiar with the system requirements so he can make sure the

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,280
infrastructure he designs will support those requirements.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,970
For example, if the system is expected to grow by three terabytes annually, the infrastructure architect

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,530
should make sure the storage for this system will be able to handle this load.

22
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,270
The career path for infrastructure architect goes through infrastructure experts.

23
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,540
You have to be well versed in infrastructure, design, implementation and configuration in order to

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,880
become a good infrastructure architect.

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,550
Next, the software architect.

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,530
The software architect, sometimes called also solution architect or system architect is responsible

27
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,360
for the architecture of the software.

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,760
Since we will be dealing with a software architect for the rest of this course, I'll skip to the enterprise

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,510
architect.

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,700
The enterprise architect works with the top management of the organization to make sure the IT of the

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,600
organization is an enabler for the business and not a hindrance in many organization's business decisions,

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,050
such as starting a new sale or entering a new business field is held back by the IT, which needs time

33
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,730
to adapt to the new requirements.

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,340
The enterprise architect usually works with a CEO and CIO of the organization to find out what are the

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,490
main bottlenecks, what holds back the IT and how it can be streamlined to support business continuity.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,770
Since the enterprise architect operates at a very high level in the organization, he has almost no

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,930
work relations with development oriented roles such as developers and team leaders.

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,240
In order to become an enterprise architect, one has to be first, a senior software architect or an

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,980
experienced project manager.

40
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,500
As I said earlier, the enterprise architect role is not very technical, and you don't always have

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,960
to have a practical, hands on experience in order to become one, although it's definitely a plus.

42
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:56,860
Great.

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,310
So having discussed other types of architects, let's meet our protagonist, the software architect.
