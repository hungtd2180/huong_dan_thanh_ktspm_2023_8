1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,220
So what is the career path for software architect?

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,060
What are the steps you must go through in order to be considered an architect?

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,510
From my own experience, and after talking with hundreds of architects, the main factor here is experience.

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,790
Since there is no formal degree or a course that qualifies you as an architect, the main factor is

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,690
potential employees will look for is experience, preferably in the technological field.

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,530
In addition, the most senior technological role you have had, the more chance you have to be an architect.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,300
Let's look at some career path examples.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,070
All of the examples assume you've begun as a developer for this course.

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,930
It doesn't matter what you did before.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,380
So here is our first career path, going straight from developer to an architect.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,670
This is not a very common path and it usually requires two condition to meet.

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,550
You have a lot of experience as a developer.

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,560
Definitely no less than three years and your company is quite small.

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,600
I see this path happens a lot in startup companies where the technical founder often functioning as

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,920
a developer gets promoted to an architect when more developers are hired.

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,600
The next path is the most common one.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,490
In this path.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,910
A developer gets promoted to a team leader and her next role is an architect.

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,730
During her tenure, the team leader does a great mix of technical work and managerial work, which allows

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,170
her to adopt a high level perspective which is so important for an architect.

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,270
When thinking of her next position, the team leader usually has to choose between a managerial path

22
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,560
and a technical path.

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,180
The managerial path will lead to a project manager position, and the technical path can lead to an

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,820
architect position, albeit a junior one.

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,610
And again, this is a very common path.

26
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,640
So if you are a team leader, you are on the right path.

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,510
The next bus is also quite common, but it leads to a senior architect role.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,760
In this path, the next stop after team leader is development manager or a CTO.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,580
Depends on the company size and the titles it uses.

30
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,560
After serving in this position for a few years, the next stop can be an architect.

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,840
Usually a CTO will become a senior architect and sometimes an enterprise architect.

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,510
There is another path, but I don't see it quite often.

33
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,450
This is the only path that does not involve technical experience and therefore I cannot say I recommend

34
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:16,900
it.

35
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,620
This path begins as a system analyst.

36
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,660
A system analyst has an excellent understanding of the system's requirements, which is a crucial quality

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,810
of an architect, but he lacks technical experience.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,630
A system analyst that would like to become an architect will usually need a long and hard training period

39
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,750
and a lot of mentoring from experienced architects.

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,330
So these are the career path for an architect.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,220
I recommend you to find out which one best describes your current career phase and prepare yourself

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,910
for the next steps that will lead you to be an exceptional software architect.
