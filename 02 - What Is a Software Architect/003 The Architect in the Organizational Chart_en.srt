00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,330
After discussing the architect's responsibility, let's look at her place in the organization chart.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,310
This is not a theoretical discussion.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,410
The location of the architect in the chart dictates her responsibilities and the scope of her work.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,090
Before taking a look at a typical organization charts, I want to emphasize a point.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,210
Architect is not and should not be a managerial position.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,740
She does not hire and fire.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,370
She does not manage vacation requests and definitely not conducting performance reviews or compensation

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,480
negotiations.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,700
The reason for that is that the architect is a professional role and has a lot to deal with.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,990
It's not a good idea to mix all her responsibilities with management tasks.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,330
So with that in mind, let's look at two typical organization charts involve the architect.

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,710
The first chart demonstrates an organization chart with a dedicated architect for each project.

13
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,280
As you can see, the architect reports to the project manager and she herself has no subordinates.

14
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,650
This is a typical, though very simplified chart where the architects are junior ones.

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,990
In this scenario, the architect sees a bigger picture but only of the project.

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,980
They are not involved with other projects in the organization and their contribution is quite limited.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,580
But keep in mind that even in this case, they have a tremendous contribution to the project.

18
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,960
Their guidance is invaluable and they do a really important job.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,380
The second chart demonstrates different scenario.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,820
In this scenario, the architect reports directly to the CIO.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,550
This is usually the case with senior experienced architects which have proven themselves valuable to

22
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,920
the organization and which has a tremendous added value at the organization level and not just the project

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,520
level.

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,460
Remember, we have talked about enterprise architects.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,920
A software architect in this position usually deals with some aspects of enterprise architecture too,

26
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,850
mainly on the technical side and less on the organizational side.

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,090
It is quite common to see both the charts combined, meaning the CIO works with the senior architect

28
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,280
and every project has its own architect.

29
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,710
In this case, the senior architect will make an organization wide decision such as global architectural

30
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,350
patterns, platforms to be used in the organization and so on.

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,930
As the project's architect will harness this guidance to the specific projects they are working on.

32
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,060
The senior architect will often provide an ongoing support to the project's architect and will make

33
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,590
sure they adhere to the organizational guidance as.
