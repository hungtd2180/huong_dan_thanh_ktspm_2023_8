1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,020
Wow.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,180
We did it.

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,570
We've just reached the end of a very long journey.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,910
You began this journey as a developer or system analyst or team leader, and you end it as an architect.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,160
Congratulations.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's have a quick review of what we learned in this course.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,760
After a brief introduction in which we talked about reasons to be an architect, we asked, What is

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,960
a software architect?

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,430
We talked about three types of architects.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,920
Infrastructure architect.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,830
Software Architect and enterprise architect.

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,440
We also talked about the architect in the organizational tree and that she should be able to code.

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,430
In the next section, we discussed the architect's mindset.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,460
We emphasized an architect must be business oriented and make sure the architecture contributes to the

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,900
bottom line of the business.

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,450
Then we talked about the architecture process and outlined the various steps that an architect should

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,500
take in order to make sure the architecture is sound and successful.

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,960
We then explored the system requirements and discussed the difference between functional and non-functional

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,920
requirements.

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,550
After the requirements, we looked at a list of the various application types and determined which type

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,950
is the best fit for each scenario.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,920
Having selected the application type, we looked at technology stack and discussed the various technologies

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,460
that are candidates for back end, front end mobile and desktop apps, as well as the difference between

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,190
relational databases and NoSQL databases.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,090
We concluded by emphasizing this decision must be made rationally.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,260
Since this topic is often quite loaded, we then met a family of quality attributes called Collectively

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,730
The Star Highlights.

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,330
We talked about scalability, manageability, modularity, extensibility and testability and explained

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,180
their importance in the overall architecture.

30
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,270
And then we started to discuss architecture.

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,690
We first talked about components architecture, explained what a component is and how it should be designed.

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,540
We also talked about layered architecture, one of the most important concepts in the architecture world,

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,650
and one that will be used in almost every application you will design.

34
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:17,070
We then learned a little bit about design patterns, although these are relevant mainly to developers.

35
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,740
We talked about their importance to the architect.

36
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,180
Having concluded the component architecture, we turned our attention to the system architecture and

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:32,990
discussed concepts such as loose coupling, stateless caching, messaging and logging and monitoring.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,020
We continued to the next section to discuss various external considerations you must be aware of, such

39
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:45,410
as deadlines and costs, and understood that ignoring them might render our architecture irrelevant.

40
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,900
And then we talked about the architecture document, probably the most important aspect of the architect's

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,470
work.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,560
This document summarizes all the architecture process and provides the team with comprehensive guidance

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,030
about their system.

44
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:06,410
And then we put it all to a practical test and discussed a real world case study of an Iot company that

45
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,770
needs a new system.

46
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,220
We went through all the steps discussed earlier and saw how to utilize them in practice.

47
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:19,190
The result of this exercise was a real practical architecture document that you can freely use in your

48
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,190
own systems.

49
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,690
Next, we discussed some advanced architecture topics such as event sourcing and microservices.

50
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,960
You won't necessarily use them, but it's a good idea to be familiar with them.

51
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,310
And last we learned about some soft skills architects have to have.

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,700
We discussed listening, dealing with criticism, public speaking and more.

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,110
All of these skills will make us all better architects and basically better persons.

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,820
And here we are at the end of it all.

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,830
I hope you had a great time in this course and I hope you've learned a lot.

56
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,690
I hope you feel ready for the next challenge and that you have all the tools you need to become a great

57
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,470
architect.

58
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,430
As always, do not hesitate to contact me with every question or comment you have.

59
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,200
I love to hear from my students and I promise to get back to you.

60
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,290
Thanks for being with me in this course and good luck in your new life as a software architect.
