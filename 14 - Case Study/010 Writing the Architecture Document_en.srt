1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,800
Well, we now have a full system architecture in place.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,030
That's great.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,320
The next logical step is to put it in writing and create an architecture document.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,620
So let's go through the various parts of the document and make sure we know what should go in each section

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,570
first.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,550
Background.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,780
Well, we already have the background here.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,390
This section describes the IO2 system, its motivation and main functionality.

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,690
Then the requirements we have well defined requirements, functional and non-functional, and we just

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,700
need to write them down in this section.

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,280
Overall architecture is our next section and here we will outline the various services and the messaging

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,000
between them.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
We have already covered this.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,680
Then we are going to drill down to each service and describe what is the role of the service, what

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,560
is its technology stack and what is its inner architecture.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,890
We have went through all this in the previous lectures and just the executive summary, as you probably

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,900
remember, the executive summary is the last section we will write, even though it appears at the beginning

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,810
of the document.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,010
Of course, we already have all the knowledge required for the executive summary.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,390
Okay, great.

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,230
It looks like we have everything needed for writing the document.
