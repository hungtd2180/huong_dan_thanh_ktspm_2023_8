00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,380
The system we are talking about is for a young, fictitious startup called Io2.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,040
If you are not familiar with the Iot term, it stands for Internet of Things and represents those small,

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,640
always connected devices that we use every day, such as home cameras, Wi-Fi routers, connected thermostats

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,660
and more.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,690
Our startup develops a dashboard system that reports in almost real time the status of the Iot devices

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:33,080
its clients are using and managing, For example, smart homes, which are becoming more and more ubiquitous,

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,060
has a lot of Iot devices.

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,880
Think about the thermostats, light bulbs, routers, cameras, electric switches, refrigerators and

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,720
lots more.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,710
Each one of them has its own app and can be managed from a smartphone.

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,720
But wouldn't it be easier to get a unified view of all those devices on a single screen?

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,170
This is what I o to is doing with this application.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,690
It collects status information from registered Iot devices and formats, the data to visually pleasing

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,700
dashboard, allowing you the customer to know exactly what is going on with your devices.

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,010
In addition, the customer can execute some predefined queries to access more information about the

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,760
devices.

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,120
It's important to note that for phase one of the system, the customer is not adding or updating any

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,630
data.

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,860
The status info is received directly from the devices in the field.

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,710
The data is just presented to the customer.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,650
Another important aspect is that the launch customers will be entered into the system manually by the

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,090
salespeople following an intensive verification process to prevent data leaks.

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,670
Because of that, the system does not have to have a registration process and you can assume the devices

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,170
are already registered.

25
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,740
You are the architect of the system and it's your job to design the architecture so that the IO2 application

26
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,630
will boost the company's business, leading it eventually to a successful IPO.

27
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,790
Now, remember, you have to follow the architecture process discussed earlier in order to achieve the

28
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,110
best architecture possible.

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,450
So what do you do next?
