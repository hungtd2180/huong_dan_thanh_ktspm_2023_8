1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,120
And as promised, here is your architecture document.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,870
In the resources section of this lecture, you can find the full architecture document of the system.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,660
We just discussed the IO2 system.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,880
In the document you will find all the sections we talked about the background requirements, executive

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,510
summary, architecture, overview and components.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,210
Drill down.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,440
You will find there are all the decisions we made complete with the rationale behind them.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,790
You will see there all the figures and diagrams that we used during our discussion.

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,220
You will find the functional and non-functional requirements.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,540
You will see the technology stack dilemma that we had and what we decided to use.

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,210
You will find all the messaging methods we are going to implement and so on and so forth.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,950
In short, you will find the full architecture we discussed formalized in an easy to read comprehensive

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,610
format.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,120
Now the good part is this Feel free to use this document as a template for your future architecture

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,840
document.

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,850
One of the major tasks of every software architect is to craft the architecture document.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,790
Using this document as a template will make your work so much easier.

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,610
Instead of beginning from scratch and trying to figure out what to write and in what order, the template

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,230
figures everything out for you.

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,370
The document sets the sections, their order and their desired content.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,490
All you have to do is simply fill in the blanks and of course, feel free to use the i o to specific

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,100
sections as a foundation of your architecture.

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,870
However you choose to use this template, I'm sure it will help you become a better, more professional

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,650
architect.

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,520
One final note before you go and download the document.

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,980
Note that at the beginning of the document there is a copyright notice that states the template is based

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,940
on this course.

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,780
Please do notrillionemove this notice it's an important part of the document.

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:49,500
So now go on and grab the file after downloading it, take the time and read through it.

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,240
Make sure you are comfortable with its structure and contents and make sure you see the correlation

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,940
between it and the discussions we had in this section.

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,110
After you have read it, let's go to the next section.
