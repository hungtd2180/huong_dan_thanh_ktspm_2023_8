00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,420
Welcome to the case study section.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,939
In this section, we are going to use all the knowledge gained throughout this course by designing architecture

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,740
of a real world application.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,960
This will be a great opportunity for you to test your knowledge of all the topics we discussed and see

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,120
their usage in the real world.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,370
The system we are going to design is quite similar to one of the systems I've been working on in recent

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,920
years.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,940
This is not a toy system specifically designed to make your life easier, but a real world application

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,910
used by real customers serving real data and cost millions to design, develop and deploy.

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,100
I've changed some details in the system description to keep customers data safe, but other than that,

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,630
that's the real deal.

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,570
In this section I'll introduce you to the application and then we will go through all the stages in

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,860
the architecture process.

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:55,100
We will talk about requirements, map the components of the architecture, select the technology stack,

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:02,100
and then design the architecture of the various components and then get yourself prepared for a real

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,820
treat.

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,950
At the end of this section, you will have the opportunity to download a complete architecture document

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,500
containing the architecture of this application.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,140
This is a real world architecture document, quite similar to the ones I prepare for my clients.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,690
You are invited to read it and even better, use it as a template for the systems you are working on.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,730
Be sure to listen closely to the usage guidelines of the document, and as long as you follow them,

22
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,080
it's yours to use.

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,480
This will make your life as an architect much easier and will boost your transition from developer to

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,340
an architect.

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,940
So let's go.
