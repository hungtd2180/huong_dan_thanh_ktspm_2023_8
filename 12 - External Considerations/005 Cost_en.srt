00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,330
The last factor we will discuss in this section is the cost factor.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,630
Sometimes we will find there is a great tool outside that solves the exact problem we have in our application.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,390
For example, a shiny modern business flow manager.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,850
But before we include it in our architecture, there is an important aspect to look at its cost.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,460
Quite often we see amazing tools that are freely available for commercial use, such as the Apache Foundation

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:24,820
tools.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,310
However, this can make us forget there are still products out there that cost a lot of money, and

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,250
this cost must be considered when designing our architecture.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,430
For example, let's look again at the business flow Manager case.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,160
We basically have two options.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,390
We can either buy one and then invest time and money in the purchase setup, training and support,

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,910
or we can develop one in-house.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,770
Now the rule of thumb is to always use an existing product instead of developing one.

14
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:56,890
But this rule must be taken with a grain of salt To validate the choice of using existing product,

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,910
we must estimate its cost versus its value to the application.

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:07,930
If the product costs $100,000 a year and has 200 features, but we only need five of them, then it

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,050
might be a good idea to look at the in-house development option.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,660
Smart and effective cost management can make the difference between successful and failed project.

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,860
Be sure to always be aware of the cost involved in the architectural decisions.
