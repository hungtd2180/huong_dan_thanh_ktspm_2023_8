00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,840
In previous sections, we discussed the architectural concept of software components and systems and

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,110
focused on professional considerations scalability, redundancy.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,890
ET cetera.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,580
However, as architects, we often employ additional considerations when making architectural decisions

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,420
considerations that have nothing to do with best practices, architecture or software.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,000
In this section, we will discuss these considerations and see how they can affect the technology stack

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,130
and architectural patterns we will use.
