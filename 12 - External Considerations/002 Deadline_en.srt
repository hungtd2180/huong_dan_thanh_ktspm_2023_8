00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,020
Let's talk about deadlines.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:08,840
Douglas Adams, the author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Series and more great books, had

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,660
a great quote about deadlines.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,780
I love deadlines.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,480
I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,040
Well, don't we all?

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,550
But seriously, deadlines are a major factor when designing our architecture.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,610
When deciding on the architectural patterns we are going to use, we must be aware, even vaguely.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,560
How long will it take to implement them?

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,230
And how does it relate to the project's deadlines?

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,670
For example, remember our messaging method discussion?

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,350
If you remember, we said that building queuing mechanism will take longer than using rest API.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,780
This is something that should be factored in when deciding on messaging platform on large projects.

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,850
This is usually not a problem, but when working on smaller systems with tight deadlines, always make

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,360
sure the architecture can be actually implemented in the given time frame.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,820
If you are not sure about that, the best thing to do is to consult with the development team leaders.

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,540
They will usually be familiar with the developer's capabilities and will be able to estimate the work

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,790
required for the architectural implementation.

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,130
Using this valuable information, you will be able to make an educated decision that factors in the

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,270
project's deadline.
