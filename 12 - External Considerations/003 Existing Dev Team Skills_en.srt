1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,210
When selecting the technology stack, which is one of the most important parts of designing a system,

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,080
always factor in the existing dev team knowledge and skills.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,050
Deciding on a technology stack that the dev team is not familiar with might cause two problems.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,380
The first is delay to the project development.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,060
The developers will have to dedicate time for training to make them familiar with the new technology.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,380
This will have effect on the project schedule and can lead to late delivery.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,140
The second potential problem is low quality.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,060
Since the system will be the first for the dev team to be developed in the selected technology stack,

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,460
the developers will not have experience with the platform and will not know how to avoid common pitfalls,

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,070
implement best practices and take advantage of some hidden gems found in every development platform.

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,900
Now, it should be noted that not all platform migrations are created equal.

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:57,140
For example, for backend developer to migrate from Dotnet to Java might require some effort, but at

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,480
the end of the day, these are quite similar platforms.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,090
And if the developer did a good job with Dotnet, he will probably be a good Java developer.

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,630
On the other hand, a Windows desktop developer migrating to Python backend development will have a

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,040
really hard time becoming a good Python developer.

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,400
Not only desktop development is conceptually very different from web development and requires a different

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,060
mindset.

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,000
The platforms themselves are completely different.

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,160
They move from object oriented statically typed language such as dotnet to the dynamic.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,990
Python might not be easy.

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,840
So to summarize, when evaluating various technology stacks, always check what the current development

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,000
team's skills are and try to understand the effect it will have on the project's schedule and quality.
