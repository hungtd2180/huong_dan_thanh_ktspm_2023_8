00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,380
Welcome to the requirements section of this course.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,590
In this section, we will discuss the basis of all the software systems in the world, the requirements.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,710
Every software is based on some kind of requirements.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,290
Some kind of user needs to accomplish something, and the software helps him to achieve this something.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,980
The requirement can be I want to apply filters on my photos or I need to communicate with my friends

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,520
easily, or even I need to be able to tune my audio recording, whatever is that the user need.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,530
These are the requirements.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,920
Of course, requirements are never left in such a high level.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:42,290
During the development cycle, they become more detailed, so the developers will have a clear idea

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,910
of what they need to develop.

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,430
In this section we will discuss two kinds of requirements and we will see how they fit in the architect's

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,860
work.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,840
Let's go.
