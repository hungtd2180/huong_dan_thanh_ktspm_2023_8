1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,480
Well, we just say that non-functional requirements are the most important requirements and that the

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,150
architect should not under any circumstances, design the system without knowing what the non-functional

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,230
requirements are.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,520
But it is equally important to be aware of the functional requirements.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,440
Many architects feel they only need to skim over the functional requirements and concentrate on the

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,730
non-functional ones.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,350
That's a mistake too.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,050
Remember our definition of the architecture?

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,660
Remember that a good architecture must improve the business bottom line.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,160
That won't be possible if you are not sure what the system should do.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,650
So before diving deep into the non-functional requirements, this is a not so gentle reminder that the

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,700
functional requirements are equally important and you have to be well versed in them.
