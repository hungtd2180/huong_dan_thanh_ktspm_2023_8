00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,430
So let's conclude what we have learned about nonfunctional requirements.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,260
These requirements define what the system will have to deal with in terms of performance.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,910
Load users.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,690
ET cetera.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,610
The client will usually won't be able to define those requirements by himself, and it will be your

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,220
job as an architect to help him define them.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,950
And perhaps the most important lesson from this section never, ever design a system without knowing

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,360
its functional requirements.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,280
The effect of those requirements on the architecture is huge, and you don't want to design a system

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,760
that will crash and burn on its first day in production.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,890
In fact, the place of the non-functional requirements in the architecture is so important that they

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,020
have their own dedicated paragraph in the architecture document, as we will see later in this course.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,600
So now that we know what non-functional requirements are and how to deal with them, let's continue

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,430
our journey in the architectural flow.
