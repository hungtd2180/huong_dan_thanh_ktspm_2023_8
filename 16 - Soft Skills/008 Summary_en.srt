In this section, we discussed soft skills every architect must have.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,160
This is not an exclusive list, and there are some skills you might want to explore, but these are

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,660
the most important ones.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,720
Always remember at the end of the day, you are not working with computers and bits and bytes.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:22,550
You are working with people and you must be able to work with people because it doesn't matter how good

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,410
you are with computers and PowerPoint.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,490
If you suck with people, you don't stand a chance.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,590
So embrace these skills, practice them and I'm sure you will see how they improve your work and make

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,840
you a better, more successful architect.
