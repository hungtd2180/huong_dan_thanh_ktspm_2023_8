1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,060
Let's face it, your walk is going to be criticized probably heavily.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:10,550
You will be questioned on almost any design element in your architecture and will be asked to explain

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,750
the logic behind it.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,390
Now, the worst thing to do with criticism is to get offended and attack back.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,840
Doing so will put you in a compromised position and will paint you as a weak, unprofessional and immature.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,570
This is not the place you want to be in.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,470
Remember, there can be a lot of reasons behind criticism.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,570
It can be a genuine questioning.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,080
Someone actually wants to make sure the architecture is sound.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,360
And she asks all the right questions.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,660
Of course, in this situation you have to be very professional and provide all the facts and logic behind

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,500
your design.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,810
Remember also, there is nothing wrong in saying, You know what, That's a good point.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,910
I didn't think about.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,060
Let me double check it.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,090
And if it checks out, I'll fix the architecture document.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,620
Such a response will only improve your image and reputation with a client and will make him appreciate

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,610
you even more.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,760
Now, what do you do with a team member trying to mock you and make everyone think how bad the architecture

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,290
is?

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,030
By the way, there can be a lot of reasons for such a behavior.

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,720
I had a client a few years back that asked me to be the chief architect of a system and to have some

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
other guy as my, well, let's call it assistant.

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,770
This guy, which I'll call John, was a lot of trouble for me.

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,610
He didn't help at all, didn't perform any task I asked him to do and always questioned the design.

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,290
Only a few months later I found out John had hoped to be the chief architect of this project and was

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,900
extremely upset by not getting this job.

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,770
He expressed his frustration by constant nagging and questioning me.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,810
So what do you do in this case?

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,310
First, do not get offended and never, ever attack back.

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,500
No matter how right you are, you have to stay professional and always be the bigger person.

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,970
Second, as before, always answer with logic and facts outraged people usually are at a loss of words

33
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,300
when faced with logic and facts, and that the best way to handle them if things get worse, set a meeting

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,030
with the manager and ask him gently to handle your own.

35
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,450
John.

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,120
But again, this is an edge case.

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,940
Not everyone who questions your design is doing so to mock, you always assume the criticism is for

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,030
a good cause and answer it calmly and professionally.
