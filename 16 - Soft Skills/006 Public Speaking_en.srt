1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,370
Public speaking is one of the most important skills of every professional.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,130
Speaking at conferences, meetups, large meetings and such is a crucial skill for everyone who wants

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,170
to get promoted or seek new, better job.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,970
But we are not talking here about every professional but rather about architects and architects specifically

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,820
must be able to speak in front of a large audience.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:29,420
Remember, architects usually have no formal authority over developers, system analyzers or project

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,050
managers.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,940
If an architect wants to influence, she should utilize her speaking skills.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,690
In addition, architects are going to take part in many meetings.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,940
Some of them are critical to the project's success, and their input is crucial.

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,530
So as an architect, you have to be able to stand in front of an audience and deliver a convincing,

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,640
effective speech.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,490
Now, this is not a course about public speaking.

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,680
There are a lot of such courses out there, but I do want to highlight some of the more important aspects

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,970
of public speaking that will help you deliver an engaging and effective speech.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,030
So let's go.

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,000
First, define a clear goal.

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,430
When you are going to talk in front of an audience, you must have a clear goal in place.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,820
Why are you doing this?

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,310
Do you want to get approval for the architecture?

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,240
Do you want to improve your image?

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,670
Do you want to get a raise?

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,800
Whatever the reason is, you must define it and be laser focused on it while speaking.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,100
This will help you improve your speech and make it more effective.

25
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,530
Second, know your audience.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,160
You should always know who you are going to talk to and adapt your talk accordingly.

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,670
For example, if you are going to talk to business analysts, it probably a good idea to avoid a long

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,800
technical discussions.

29
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,780
They won't understand it and it will get them bored.

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,420
Third, be confident or if you are terrified, pretend to be confident.

31
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,700
People tend to respect and believe someone who is confident about what he has to say.

32
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,980
If your talk is full, with whom and a, it won't look good and people will lose you.

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,910
You have to let them know or think that you know what you are talking about.

34
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,420
Fourth, don't read ever.

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,039
One of the biggest mistakes public speakers do is to read from a slide.

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,650
Your audience is a smart, grown up people.

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,850
They know how to read.

38
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,780
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,180
The accompanying slides should be used to make a point and to visualize concepts.

40
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,390
Under no circumstances should they contain the content itself.

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,150
Fifth, maintain eye contact.

42
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,480
Always look at your audience and make sure to look at everyone.

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,060
One of the common mistakes of public speakers is to focus on a single attendee and look only at him

44
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,900
along the talk.

45
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,420
This will make the poor attendee feel uncomfortable and make the rest of your audience feel like you

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,500
don't talk to them.

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,610
Okay, so these were some highlights about public speaking.

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,410
And again, I would highly recommend looking at some resources and reading some books about it.

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,360
It's one of the most important skills and architects should have and you should be an expert in that

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,990
field.
