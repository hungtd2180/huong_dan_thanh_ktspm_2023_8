1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,750
One very important soft skill that every architect and actually every professional must have is not

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,700
trying to be right all the time.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,880
What does it mean?

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,270
Well, imagine the following scenario.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,260
You're in a meeting presenting the architecture you have designed for the system.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,200
Suddenly, one of the attendees raises his hand and he has a question which goes something along these

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,810
lines.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,620
I think the stateless pattern is useless here.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,750
It will hurt the performance and will make the code much more complex.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,980
We should go for stateful here.

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,170
Now you know he is not right.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,380
You know that stateless is the best way to go here since the system is going to face a heavy load and

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,600
since the uptime requirement is quite high.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,590
Stateless is a natural choice here, But how should you respond?

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,450
The first instinct is to say something like, well, you're wrong.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,170
Stateless is the best way because this and that.

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,590
After all, you are right here, aren't you?

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,840
But let's think about it a little more.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,970
There is one important thing we should never forget.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,950
What is the goal of this meeting?

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,430
What do we want to achieve?

22
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,030
Well, in this case, the answer is easy.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,760
We want to get approval for the architecture.

24
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,320
Okay, Now let's see.

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,110
Who is the guy that asked the question?

26
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,880
He is the CTO.

27
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,020
He is the one that his approval you need the most.

28
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:25,480
So now the question you need to ask yourself is this what kind of response will help me get the approval?

29
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,660
Do I need to show him that I'm right and smarter than him?

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,560
Will that help me achieve my goal?

31
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,030
Or perhaps I should take a different approach.

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,430
Let's see if you will tell the CTO that he is wrong.

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,370
You are risking creating an antagonism towards you.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
You don't want that.

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,520
If you will do that, you will probably be right, but hurt your chances of achieving the goal of the

36
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,090
meeting.

37
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,410
So what you really need to do here is being smart instead of right.

38
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,020
And being smart means doing the thing that will help you achieve your goal instead of doing the thing

39
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,580
that will make you feel right.

40
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,430
And what is a smart response?

41
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,140
Well, I would suggest something like that.

42
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,870
Yep, that's a great point.

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,100
We actually had a lot of thinking about this specific issue and we believe this is the better option.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,910
Let's have an offline chat and discuss it in length.

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,130
Now, look what you did here.

46
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:20,410
First, you gave the CTO a lot of respect by telling him that this is a great point and that the decision

47
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,370
was not easy.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,590
You did not dismiss his question as nonsense and did not tell him he was wrong.

49
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,130
Second, you offered a private meeting to discuss the issue.

50
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,220
Again, you show a lot of respect by offering that.

51
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,860
Third and most important, you avoided a long, boring, tiresome technical discussion in the middle

52
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,640
of the meeting by suggesting you take this offline.

53
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,110
You don't need to deep dive into it right now.

54
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,460
In the middle of the meeting.

55
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,340
By the way, my experience shows that most of the managers will be happy that you offered them the meeting,

56
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,020
but it won'trillioneally take place.

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,700
They are too busy for that.

58
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,650
And now look what you've got.

59
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:03,040
Instead of a CTO who is mightily offended by you telling him he was wrong and by you explaining in length

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,980
why he was wrong, You now have a CTO that feels you respect him and his viewpoint and does not feel

61
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,000
dismissed by you.

62
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,210
Which CTO is more probable to approve your architecture?

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,190
You guessed it the second one.

64
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,260
And all this just because you did the smart thing and not the one that made you feel right.

65
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,980
So always keep in mind, be smart, not right.
