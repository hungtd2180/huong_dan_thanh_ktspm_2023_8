1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,780
And here we are at the last skill we will discuss.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:11,190
And this is a simple yet very important one and it can be summarized like this Always keep learning.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,910
We live in a dynamic world and the software world is even more so.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,310
Things are changing in a blink of an eye.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,870
Frameworks that were all the rage just three years ago are now completely forgotten.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,160
You have probably heard of jQuery, Grant, AngularJS and Hadoop.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,070
All these frameworks and engines were extremely popular not many years ago but now are almost never

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,520
used.

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,750
They were succeeded by better alternatives.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,220
Now some don't like this fast pace, but that's a fact of life.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,140
One of the most famous quotes in the business world is adapt or die.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,130
Although its origin is not clear, it still holds a lot of truth.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,880
You should always look around and check what's new.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,000
If there are new patterns or technologies, follow them.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,690
You don't need to immediately embrace them, but should definitely keep an eye on them.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,280
So when time comes, you will know what to do.

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,320
Now how to do this learning?

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,930
Where can you find the knowledge relevant for architects?

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,340
Here is what I do.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,190
My main sources for knowledge are blogs, articles and conferences.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,410
There are a lot of blogs and articles sites dedicated to technology and architecture.

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,410
Some of the more popular are D Zone, InfoQ and O'Reilly.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,510
Subscribe to these sites and you will get a lot of quality information.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,110
In addition to that, I go once a year to a conference about software and architecture.

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:37,660
My favorites are O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference, Infocus, Qcon, NDC and Microsoft Build.

26
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,590
But of course, you might find other conferences you find useful.

27
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,780
These conferences are a great opportunity for firsthand meeting with the most talented people in the

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,690
industry and for learning about the newest trends and developments you should be aware of.

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,880
And it's always fun to visit new places and meet new people.

30
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,650
So the bottom line is this Whatever method you pick, always keep learning.

31
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,700
Don't get left behind with outdated knowledge and skills.

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,600
Make sure you can contribute to your clients in this fast changing world.
