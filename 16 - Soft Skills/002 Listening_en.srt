00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,360
One of the most important soft skills that not enough architects possess is listening.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,210
Sounds quite simple, I know, but I've met countless architects that behaved as if they already know

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,850
all that is to know about software, architecture, technology requirements and the specific project

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,580
and were simply not pleasant to work with.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,940
One of the key factors in a successful teamwork is the ability to listen and to assume you are not the

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,530
smartest person in the room.

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,920
This assumption, regardless if true or not, will help you become a better team player and as a result,

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,240
a better architect.

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,410
Think about it.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,360
If you are not the smartest man in the room, then you should probably listen to what the other people

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,590
in the room have to say.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,460
They might have some clever thoughts worth sharing and using.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,410
You know, collective wisdom is almost always better than a soloist work.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,260
Even if you are sure you have just designed the best architecture possible.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,650
Always assume you forgot something or wasn't aware of all the implications of the requirements or didn't

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,050
think about certain scheduling restrictions.

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,200
Talk about your work and more important, listen to what others have to say about it.

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,610
It will make your work so much better.
