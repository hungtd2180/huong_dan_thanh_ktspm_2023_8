00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,690
Welcome to the Soft Skills section.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,240
In order to be a great architect, it's not enough to be well-versed in technology stacks, architectural

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,940
patterns, and coding best practices.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,150
A great architect must have great soft skills.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:20,360
These soft skills are essential when communicating with a project team from the developers to the project

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,180
manager and even the CTO and CEO.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,700
Let's think about it for a moment.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,140
A software architect is in a very unique position in the organizational tree.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,720
She has a very deep knowledge about the application and its architecture, and she is expected to guide

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,390
the development team about the actual implementation.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,890
But in reality, she has no authority over them.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,480
She can't command the team What to do.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,370
She can only recommend.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,760
Now, if the architect is an arrogant, righteous person that makes everybody else feel inferior, no

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,200
one will want to work with him.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,950
And as a result, no one would want to implement the architecture.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:04,379
The architect must be able to make the team do what he wants without the actual authority over them.

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,560
This is called influence without authority, and this is one of the biggest challenges in the software

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,190
world.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,550
You don't want to make the developers do as you say because they have to, but because they want to.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,280
In this section, we will explore some soft skills that will greatly help you improve your communication

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,460
skills with the team and make them want to work with you.

23
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,250
Learning and internalizing these skills will make you a better architect, someone who is extremely

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,010
nice to work with and as an added bonus, also a better person, which is always good.

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,480
So let's go.
