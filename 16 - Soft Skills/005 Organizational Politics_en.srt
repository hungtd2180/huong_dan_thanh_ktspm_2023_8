1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,380
So here are the bad news.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,400
You have to be familiar with the organizational politics.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,310
Yes, we all want to deal only with architectural patterns, technology stacks and so on.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,100
But many times in order to be a real successful architect and in order to leave a mark, you will have

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,450
to be well aware of the organizational politics instead of lengthy explanations.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,820
Let's go straight to an actual example.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,330
In one of the clients I worked for, there was a CIO who just couldn't stand the idea of microservices.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,810
He was genuinely terrified by this concept and claimed it's a new, untested and immature pattern that

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,790
will disappear over time and we will all go back to the good old three tier applications in the near

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,510
future.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,870
I obviously couldn't disagree more, but no matter what I told him which case study, I've let him read

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,610
which articles I presented him.

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,710
He wouldn't move and stayed fixed.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,610
In his opinion, which is no microservices is our organization.

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,310
So I had some casual discussions with some other managers in the organization and found something interesting.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,500
The CIO was going to be replaced in about two months by another manager who is currently a project manager.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,840
So what did I do with this information?

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,920
Quite simple.

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,530
I became friends with this project manager.

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,000
We had some very friendly discussions, found some common grounds between us.

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,740
It turned out we went to high schools in the same city and overall had a good time.

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,840
After a while our discussions became more professional and we began discussing his future job.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,900
I then let him know about the microservices pattern and assured him it's a good, effective and tested

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,590
pattern.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,590
It didn't take more than three such discussions and he became a fan of the microservices pattern.

26
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,360
And what do you think was the first decision he made right after sitting in the CEO's chair?

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,790
Of course, approving the microservices pattern for the specific project I've worked on.

28
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,810
So as you can see, being aware of organizational politics can be quite helpful, but you have to,

29
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,020
at all costs, not be part of the politics.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,490
You should know what's going on.

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,400
You should be familiar with the relevant people, but never ever engage yourself in political moves.

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,400
It may give you some short term leverage, but in the long term it will hurt you and hurt you badly.
